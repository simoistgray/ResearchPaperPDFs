"McKenzie, Brian D.. ""Barack Obama, Jeremiah Wright, and Public Opinion in the 2008 Presidential Primaries"". Political Psychology 32, no. 6 (2011)","This study examines the broad political impact of controversial sermons by Jeremiah Wright, Barack Obama's former pastor, which aired during the 2008 presidential primaries. Although commentators speculated about the possible repercussions of this event for Obama's candidacy, no one has actually tested these claims in practice and positioned the episode within a larger narrative of American racial politics. Using national survey data, I discuss differences between Blacks' and Whites' perceptions of the videos and their effects on citizens' attitudes. Among Whites, individuals who are bothered by Wright's assertions feel negatively toward Obama and express apprehension about his ability to unite people around common goals. Blacks' familiarity with African American religion provides a context for understanding the messages and they are not distracted by the controversy. More generally, the findings emphasize that cultural differences among groups help explain variation in opinions, shows how unflattering news reports influence evaluations of Black candidates, and highlights the significance of racial issues in political campaigns.",University of Maryland,[]
"Schaffner, Brian F.. ""Racial Salience and the Obama Vote"". Political Psychology 32, no. 6 (2011)","Barack Obama's successful campaign for president renewed both scholarly and popular interest in understanding the extent to which race remains a barrier for African American candidates in American elections. Despite a substantial body of work that indicates that African Americans do face significant barriers to winning White votes, initial interpretations of the 2008 election results suggest that the Obama vote was not depressed because of his race. In this paper, I introduce a relatively unobtrusive measure of racial salience to examine whether these initial interpretations are correct. I find that when race was a more salient factor for White voters, they were substantially less likely to vote for Obama and were more likely to think that Obama was focusing attention on African Americans during the campaign. I estimate that the salience of race for some Whites may have cost Obama as much as 3% of the White vote. Thus, this paper indicates that even in Obama's historic 2008 campaign, African American candidates continue to face barriers to winning White support.","University of Massachusetts, Amherst",[]
"Dragojlovic, Nicolas Isak. ""Priming and the Obama Effect on Public Evaluations of the United States"". Political Psychology 32, no. 6 (2011)",This article investigates the psychological basis for the dramatic improvement in the Canadian public's evaluations of the United States following President Obama's inauguration. It attributes this change to a media priming effect triggered by Obama's increased visibility in Canadian news coverage of the United States in 2008 and 2009. A survey experiment conducted on a sample of undergraduate students at a Canadian university is used to illustrate this priming effect. Mentioning President Obama in an unrelated question leads participants to evaluate the United States more positively than in a control group. This assimilation effect is particularly strong when compared to a condition in which former President Bush is mentioned instead of President Obama. The results also show that the Obama priming effect is moderated by political awareness such that individuals with intermediate levels of awareness are most sensitive to the Obama prime.,University of British Columbia,[]

Political Psychology 32, no. 6 (2011)","President Obama's weekly radio addresses to the nation during his first two years in office were scored using thematic content analysis (TCA). TCA is a method for deriving quantitative data from qualitative materials through the use of detailed scoring manuals applied to oral or written texts by trained, reliable scorers. We scored the addresses for integrative complexity (IC), motive imagery (MI), and universal values. Obama's mean IC was second highest among recent presidents. His IC fluctuated in response to situational parameters, rising when he was negotiating and maneuvering his policies through Congress, falling when stress was high and a problem seemed amenable to a simple solution. His MI showed Achievement as his predominant motive. Achievement, Security, and Power were highest in his value hierarchy, which remained stable throughout the period; surprisingly, his ranking of Self-Direction was much lower than a previously published pan-cultural average. Last, we identified six clusters, time periods when his IC and Power imagery moved in opposite directions. The implications of this pattern for cooperative versus adversarial approaches in problem solving are discussed.",The University of British Columbia,[]
"Renshon, Stanley A.. ""Redemption, Fairness, and the Politics of Transformation in the Obama Presidency"". Political Psychology 32, no. 6 (2011)","Every new president raises many questions in the public mind. Because Barack Obama was a relative newcomer to the national political scene, he raised more questions than most and still does two years into his presidency. Who is Barack Obama, really? I trace the intertwined developmental arcs of the president's late-blooming ambition and his ambivalent relationships with both of his parents and his own core identity. Obama's efforts to reconcile the conflicting experiences and feelings he had as he navigated these psychological currents have a great deal to do with how he has approached his presidency. Obama is a president of enormous intelligence and considerable political skill, but his presidency has faltered in part because of the mismatch between his redemptive and transformational ambitions and the public's willingness and readiness to support them.",The City University of New York,[]
"Winter, David G.. ""Philosopher-King or Polarizing Politician? A Personality Profile of Barack Obama"". Political Psychology 32, no. 6 (2011)","Although U.S. President Barack Obama received extensive media coverage during the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign and later during the first two years of his presidency, many people still perceive him as elusive, or even contradictory. Using biographical facts and objective at-a-distance measures, this article presents a personality profile of Obama. The profile is organized around a fourfold conception of personality. Personality can be understood as the residue of past and present social contexts and is publicly visible as traits or consistencies of style. Internal beliefs, values, and other cognitions, as well as implicit motives, can only be indirectly observed and so are measured through content analysis. The resulting profile is used to explain some outcomes, as well as paradoxes and puzzles of Obama's performance as president. It also suggests predictions about the future course of his presidency.",University of Michigan,[]
"Elcheroth, Guy, Willem Doise, Stephen Reicher. ""On the Knowledge of Politics and the Politics of Knowledge: How a Social Representations Approach Helps Us Rethink the Subject of Political Psychology"". Political Psychology 32, no. 5 (2011)","Fifty years ago, Serge Moscovici first outlined a theory of social representations. In this article, we attempt to discuss and to contextualize research that has been inspired by this original impetus from the particular angle of its relevance to political psychology. We argue that four defining components of social representations need to be taken into account, and that these elements need to be articulated with insights from the social identity tradition about the centrality of self and group constructions in order to develop original insights into political psychological phenomena. First, social representations are shared knowledge, and the way interpretations of the world are collectively elaborated is critical to the way people are able to act within the world. Second, social representations are meta-knowledge, which implies that what people assume relevant others know, think, or value is part of their own interpretative grid, and that collective behavior can often be influenced more powerfully at the level of meta-representations than of intimate beliefs. Third, social representations are enacted communication, which means that social influence is exerted by the factors that constrain social practices as much as by the discourse that interprets these practices.Fourth, social representations are world-making assumptions: collective understandings do not only reflect existing realities but often bring social reality into being. Put together, these four components provide a distinctive theoretical perspective on power, resistance and conflict. The added conceptual value of this perspective is illustrated by showing how it allows revisiting ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia. We conclude with implications for research practices and discuss how the proposed model of social representations invites us to define new priorities and challenges for the methods used to study political psychological phenomena.",University of Lausanne,"['University of Geneva', 'University of St Andrews']"

Political Psychology 32, no. 5 (2011)","This commentary outlines an approach to social representations which emphasizes the normative and dynamic nature of shared knowledge. Social representations both connect and divide people, for example through shared ingroup and outgroup stereotypes derived from antagonistic social representations. Through asymmetrical intergroup communication and influence, in turn, social representations are formed, maintained, and contested. In this dynamic process, powerful majorities attempt to define the meaning of new or otherwise important information as a function of their group norms, while subordinate minorities employ propaganda techniques of social influence to resist majority influence and propose alternative positions.",University of Lausanne,[]

Political Psychology 32, no. 5 (2011)","In this article, we first suggest that the approach presented by Elcheroth, Doise, and Reicher is particularly relevant in view of the ""neuroscientific turn ""that faces political psychology. Thus, we note that the distinction between content and process and the predilection for general, intrapsychological, and content-free explanations of political cognition and behavior are encouraged by these developments. We contrast the contribution of the social representations approach to the understanding of social conflict and social change with the approach promoted by these new perspectives. Next, we consider the four themes highlighted by Elcheroth et al. as distinctive of the social representations approach. We notice convergences between these themes and several areas of u mainstream ""social and political psychology and show that several of these themes have surfaced in these fields without making reference to this approach.",Cardiff University,['Universite Libre de Bruxelles']

"Thorisdottir, Hulda, John T. Jost. ""Motivated Closed-Mindedness Mediates the Effect of Threat on Political Conservatism"". Political Psychology 32, no. 5 (2011)","In this article we synthesize theory and research from several areas of psychology and political science to propose and test a causal model of the effects of threat on political attitudes. Based in part on prior research showing that fear, threat, and anxiety decrease cognitive capacity and motivation, we hypothesize that under high (vs. low) threat, people will seek to curtail open-ended information searches and exhibit motivated closedmindedness (one aspect of the need for cognitive closure). The subjective desire for certainty, control, and closure, in turn, is expected to increase the individual's affinity for political conservatism, insofar as resistance to change and adherence to authority figures and conventional forms of morality are assumed to satisfy these epistemic motives more successfully than their ideological opposites. Consistent with this account, we find in Studies la and lb that putting people into a highly threatened mindset leads them to exhibit an increase in motivated closed-mindedness and to perceive the world as more dangerous. Furthermore, in Study 2 we demonstrate that a subtle threat manipulation increases selfreported conservatism (or decreases self-reported liberalism), and this effect is mediated by closed-mindedness. In Study 3, we manipulated closed-mindedness directly and found that high (vs. low) cognitive load results in a greater affinity for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party. Finally, in Study 4 we conducted an experiment involving political elites in Iceland and found that three different types of threat (to the self, group, and system) all led center-right politicians to score higher on closed-mindedness and issue-based political conservatism. Implications for society and for the theory of ideology as motivated social cognition are discussed.",University of Iceland,['New York University']
"Nelson, Thomas E., Gregory Gwiasda, Joseph Lyons. ""Vilification and Values"". Political Psychology 32, no. 5 (2011)","Social values are an important foundation of political attitudes, yet political controversies often embody conflicts between values, placing the citizen in an awkward position of having to prioritize competing values. One strategy is to consider the groups that are symbolically associated with the competing values. Groups held in high esteem will enhance associated values; groups held in disregard will diminish associated values. Persuasive communicators exploit this process by assailing groups that have been publicly associated with certain issue positions or values as ""extreme ""or ""radical. ""Even if the group represents a consensus value like equal opportunity, the extremist label suggests the group's agenda embodies an excessive and uncompromising imposition of this value. This article reports on four experiments that investigated how the extremist label can undermine support for a group's position.

"Wright, Matthew. ""Diversity and the Imagined Community: Immigrant Diversity and Conceptions of National Identity"". Political Psychology 32, no. 5 (2011)","As immigrant diversity increases across most developed democracies, there is an increasing concern that perceived threats to mainstream interests (both cultural and economic) will produce an ethnocentric response. This study approaches the question using survey measures that explicitly tap respondents 1 normative conception of membership in the national community. Based on cross-sectional and over-time analysis of the ISSP's ""National Identity Module, ""it shows that more immigrant-exclusive definitions of the national ingroup are linked to both contextual and individual measures of cultural threat. Perceived economic threat at the individual level is also powerfully linked to this outcome, but contextual measures of economic prosperity are not. This finding lends weight to the argument that increasing levels of immigrant diversity are a threat to an inclusive sense of national identity that includes both natives and immigrants.","John F.

"Thornton, Judd R.. ""Ambivalent or Indifferent? Examining the Validity of an Objective Measure of Partisan Ambivalence"". Political Psychology 32, no. 5 (2011)","This article examines the validity of an objective measure of partisan ambivalence. More generally, it draws attention to the idea that measurement is an active step taken by the researcher and therefore should be subjected to empirical examination. It is also argued that treating a variable at a higher level of measurement than warranted will cause a valid measure to cease to be so, and that the appropriate level of a variable is determined not by the underlying concept or the measurement procedure, but by the researcher. I demonstrate the measure examined can distinguish between various attitudinal states, but only at the nominal level. This is largely driven by individuals who offer no responses to open-ended questions, who are termed indifferent. Furthermore, different coding schemes result in different conclusions. For example, the finding that indifferent individuals are less likely to rely on partisanship than ambivalent individuals when evaluating candidates is obscured when treating the measure as interval The findings suggest the measure should be coded to account for indifferent individuals, and that even well developed measures of clearly defined concepts need to be subjected to empirical examination.",Georgia State University,[]

More specifically, we argue that simply positioning a summary attitudinal question after a balanced series of relevant items can increase people's ability to answer in a way that better reflects their underlying interests, values, and predispositions. By manipulating the location of the vote preference question in two separate national election campaign surveys, we find that there are fewer undecided respondents when the question is asked at the end of the survey rather than early on, that some people are changing their mind during the questionnaire, that a larger set of determinants is structuring late-survey vote choice, and that voting preferences based on the later question are a better predictor of the actual vote.

It also compared the importance of personal values and sociodemographic variables as determinants of political orientation. Hypotheses drew on the different histories, prevailing culture, and socioeconomic level of three sets of countries—liberal, traditional, and postcommunist. As hypothesized, universalism and benevolence values explained a left orientation in both liberal and traditional countries and conformity and tradition values explained a right orientation; values had little explanatory power in postcommunist countries. Values predicted political orientation more strongly than sociodemographic variables in liberal countries, more weakly in postcommunist countries, and about equally in traditional countries.",The Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"['University of Zurich, Switerland']"
"Fausey, Caitlin M., Teenie Matlock. ""Can Grammar Win Elections?"". Political Psychology 32, no. 4 (2011)","The wording of political messages is known to affect voting behavior, including judgments about whether or not candidates will be elected. Yet the question remains whether voting behavior can be influenced by fine-grained grammatical details of political messages. In this paper, two studies examined how subtly different grammatical forms in descriptions of political candidates' past actions can affect attitudes about electability. Specifically, participants read about a senator who was seeking reelection and then indicated whether they thought the politician would be reelected. In Study 1, the senator had done either negative or positive actions, and these were described using imperfective (was VERB + ing) or perfective (VERB + ed) aspect. In Study 2, the senator had done a negative and a positive action, one of which was described using imperfective and the other with perfective aspect. Results revealed that imperfective descriptions of negative actions resulted in greater confidence that the candidate would not be reelected. Imperfective descriptions also led people to think that the candidate had done more negative action. When a negative and positive action were described together, grammar again influenced electability such that people reasoned in line with whatever action was highlighted by imperfective aspect. In both studies, subtle differences in grammar influenced whether people thought a political candidate would be reelected. These findings provide novel insights about how language can shape thought in the political realm.",Indiana University,"['University of California, Merced']"
"Miller, Patrick R.. ""The Emotional Citizen: Emotion as a Function of Political Sophistication"". Political Psychology 32, no. 4 (2011)","Scholars and popular commentators have often stereotyped emotion as a tool that citizens use to reason about politics in place of hard fact and critical thought. Indeed, critics have often seen emotion as a potentially dangerous force that can sway the unsophisticated masses to undesirable ends. This article challenges the view that emotion is an outgrowth of low sophistication, arguing that high sophisticates are more likely to experience emotion in reaction to politics and that emotions are more influential on the political behavior of high sophisticates. Drawing upon appraisal theory, this article develops a theory of how political engagement elicits emotionality about politics, and how emotion interacts with understanding and motivation to produce its greatest impact on the behavior of those citizens who are the most politically sophisticated. Behavioral effects are examined in the contexts of presidential voting behavior and Iraq War policy attitudes. Hypotheses are tested on pooled American National Election Studies (ANES) data and an original web-based survey of undergraduates.",Duke University,[]

Recent evidence in the area of morality, however, shows that morally based attitudes are particularly resistant to persuasion and can result in the rejection of disagreeing others. Positing that considering morality would reduce network influence, an experiment varied moral cues presented along with a non-network persuasive message while holding the actual content constant. Results demonstrate that morality and network composition interact to predict persuasion, such that when people are not cued to consider morality increased network heterogeneity predicts increased persuasion, but when identical messages are presented in a way that invokes morality the impact of network heterogeneity disappears or even reverses marginally. This interactive effect was replicated in two very different political issues: gay adoption and nationalized healthcare. Implications for persuasion by morally motivated sources independent of the effects of specific moral arguments are discussed.",Tel Aviv University,['Stony Brook University']

Political Psychology 32, no. 4 (2011)","We examine support for policies affecting indigenous ethnic minorities in Chile. Specifically, we examine the role of national group definitions that include the largest indigenous group—the Mapuche—in different ways. Based on questionnaire data from nonindigenous Chilean students (N = 338), we empirically distinguish iconic inclusion, whereby the Mapuche are seen as an important part of Chile's history and identity on the one hand, from egalitarian inclusion, which represents the Mapuche as citizens of equal importance to the nonindigenous majority on the other. Both forms of inclusion positively predict support for indigenous rights, independent of participants' political affiliation, strength of national identification, and social distance. A second study (N = 277) replicates this finding whilst controlling for right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, blind patriotism, and constructive patriotism. It also finds iconic inclusion to be predictive of a pro-Mapuche position regarding the unrest over the issue of ancestral land in 2009. We conclude that understanding how national identity affects attitudes about minority rights necessitates appreciating the importance of particular meanings of nationality, and not only the strength of identification.",Queen's University Belfast,"['Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile', 'University of Sussex']"

This article examines the influence of Latino political identity on voting preferences in the 2006 California gubernatorial election.

Political Psychology 32, no. 3 (2011)","In this paper, we trace the route by which genetics could ultimately connect to issue attitudes and suggest that central to this connection are chronic dispositional preferences for mass-scale social rules, order, and conduct— what we label political ideology. The need to resolve bedrock social dilemmas concerning such matters as leadership style, protection from outgroups, and the degree to which norms of conduct are malleable, is present in any large-scale social unit at any time. This universality is important in that it leaves open the possibility that genetics could influence stances on issues of the day. Here, we measure orientation to these bedrock principles in two ways — a survey of conscious, self-reported positions and an implicit association test (IAT) of latent orientations toward fixed or flexible rules of social conduct. In an initial test, both measures were predictive of stances on issues of the day as well as of ideological self-labeling, thereby suggesting that the heritability of specific issue attitudes could be the result of the heritability of general orientations toward bedrock principles of mass-scale group life.",University of Nebraska-Lincoln,"['University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign', 'Rice University']"

Political Psychology 32, no. 3 (2011)","Ethnic minorities often have shown higher mean levels of authoritarianism compared to Whites. However, no theoretical mechanism has been directly tested to explain these ethnicity differences. Using the stigma literature as a framework, two studies are presented that test a novel explanation for this difference, rooted in the devaluing that accompanies being a member of a stigmatized group in society. The results show that, in Study 1, ethnic minorities reported higher levels of authoritarianism in ways that could not be explained by traditional explanations of authoritarianism, including lower income, lower education, or lack of cognitive complexity. However, in Study 2, when participants were given the opportunity to affirm their sense of worth, ethnic minorities did not differ in their mean levels of authoritarianism compared to Whites.

Yet is there any evidence that candidates use emotional appeals strategically during campaigns? Is there a pattern to their use? For instance, are fear appeals used primarily late in the campaign by trailing candidates in order to get voters to rethink their choices? And are enthusiasm appeals used more commonly early on in order to shore up a candidate's base? We use affective intelligence theory — and supplement it with the idea of a voter backlash — to generate expectations about when candidates use certain emotional appeals (namely, anger, fear, enthusiasm, and pride) and which types of candidates are most likely to do so. We then test these ideas using campaign advertising data from several U. S. Senate races from 2004. Our research thus provides a link between research on campaign decision making — here the decision to ""go emotional"" — and research focusing on the effects of emotional appeals on voters.",Washington State University,[]

Indeed, the 2008 presidential race was replete with campaign messages showcasing such perspectives — that Barack Obama and John McCain were religiously faithful and deeply patriotic. Scholarship demonstrates the potential political power of explicit appeals to America and Christianity; however, little research has examined (a) citizens* perceptions of candidates* ties to faith and nation and (b) how these impressions may be related to electoral attitudes and intended vote. We address this gap, measuring both explicit and implicit indicators of the Christian-ness and American-ness of Obama and McCain. We expected and found that both explicit and — in a final-entry regression position — implicit perceptions of these traits related to voters' overall candidate attitudes and intended vote choice and that they were connected significantly more strongly for our sample of self-described Republicans than Democrats.

Political Psychology 32, no. 3 (2011)","The persistence of traditional monarchies in modern societies, which are otherwise characterized by democratic and egalitarian values, remains a paradox in the social sciences. In part this is attributable to the lack of psychological investigation into the relationship between subject and sovereign, and in particular the ways in which the political and social values of the citizenry shape understandings of a hereditary monarch's right to represent a national community. Adopting the qualitative analysis methods of discursive psychology and grounded theory, the current study examines vernacular accounts of nationhood and monarchy in England in both formalized conversational interviews (n = 60) and impromptu street interviews (n = 56). Focusing on accounts of Prince Charles's recent proposal to change the role of the monarch, from ""Defender of the (Christian) Faith"" to ""Defender of Faiths, ""those in favor treated it as a positive step towards reflecting a diverse (religious) community, bringing the monarchy into line with current concerns of pluralism and upholding values of personal choice and individual rights. Participants who rejected the proposed change in title construed it as antithetical to these values in terms of reflecting personal stake and interest, an abuse of power, or an imposition on other faiths. In all accounts, the prime concern was in safeguarding the political and social values of the citizenry. In conclusion it is argued that the study of subjects' relationship to the monarch, its function and legitimacy, can provide an opportunity to examine how values can characterize a national community and facilitate national diversity.",Lancaster University,['University of Limerick']

I test this partisan ambivalence explanation on split-ticket votes between president and Congress nationally between 1988 and 2004 and voting for state executive offices in Ohio in 1998.1 find that partisan ambivalence predicts ticket splitting at both the national and state levels and does so about as well as some other explanations.

We take an inductive approach to understanding the stereotypes of Black politicians. Employing a classic psychology research design (Katz & Braly, 1933) in which respondents list traits for a target group, we find that there is little overlap of stereotype content between Black politicians and Blacks. Our results therefore indicate that Black politicians constitute a separate and unique subtype of Blacks. Our analysis explores similarities and differences between stereotypes of Black politicians and two other groups: Black professionals (another subtype of Blacks) and politicians. We discuss the implications of our findings for the relationship between stereotypes and voter decisions.",Miami University,['College of Wooster']

"Nets-Zehngut, Rafi. ""Palestinian Autobiographical Memory Regarding the 1948 Palestinian Exodus"". Political Psychology 32, no. 2 (2011)","Background: Collective memory of intractable conflict is an important sociopsychological phenomenon which influences the psychological and behavioral reactions of each party to the conflict. This memory is composed of two kinds of memories: autobiographical memory—the memory of the people who experienced the given events directly—and indirect-collective memory—the memory of the people who learned about the given events second hand, via books, etc. Purpose: This study explores the characteristics of Palestinian autobiographical memory with respect to the causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus and how it relates to other Palestinian memories of that exodus (official, historical/academic, and indirect-collective). From these empirical findings, theoretical insights are concluded. Method: This is done by analyzing the content of four oral history projects of 1948 Palestinians refugees (in total, 131 interviewees from 38 localities). In addition, the content of these projects is compared to the accounts of documented Israeli history (using the research of Israeli historian Benny Morris). Studies of the other Palestinian memories are also used. Findings: The findings reveal that the Palestinian autobiographical memory is not a typical memory of conflict (e.g., with relatively low focus on the expulsion cause for the exodus). It is also compatible to a large degree with documented Israeli history. However, it is very different from other Palestinian memories of the exodus (official, historical/academic, and indirect-collective), which focus almost exclusively on the expulsion cause. Other empirical findings and their explanations are discussed. The findings have mostly theoretical implications regarding various kinds of memories of conflicts (and memories in general), as well as some methodological implications with regard to the usage of oral history.",Tel Aviv University,[]

Neither have there been more than occasional efforts to mobilize the distinction between ""proximate ""and ""ultimate ""explanations, with most proposed explanations being proximate. Here we draw on content analyses from materials written by Japanese Kamikaze pilots to propose an evolvable cognitive algorithm—by hypothesis, species typical—that (1) specifies environmental circumstances under which such ""heroic ""behavior is likely; (2) is consistent at the proximate level with the Japanese data; and (3) that is not inconsistent with many of the diverse proximate attitudes, values, and psychological mechanisms that dominate discussions of contemporary suicide campaigns. The evolutionary perspective is not an alternative to most of the proximate explanations offered in discussions of contemporary cases but is, rather, a paradigm around which diverse proximate explanations can be organized.",University of Oregon,['Waseda University']

Political Psychology 32, no. 2 (2011)","The theory of affective intelligence posits that an individual's emotions help govern a reliance on political habits or, alternatively, deliberation and attention to new political information. Some of the evidence adduced draws on the fact that voters who are anxious about their own party's candidate do not rely blindly on their partisanship but instead consider policy and personality when they vote. In a provocative paper, Ladd and Lenz (2008) argue that emotions reflect an evaluative judgment, akin to likes and dislikes, that has little to say about attention and habit. Here we examine the ANES data from 1980 to 2004 and find that the affective intelligence theory's original findings remain statistically robust. On closer examination, we also learn that Ladd and Lenz reformulated the theoretical test by using a different ope rationalization of affect and a different dependent variable and found results at variance from ours. We find it an inappropriate test. In the end, we agree with Ladd and Lenz that cross-sectional data cannot crisply test the short-term impact of emotions on attention and habit and concur that ultimately experiments will move the debate forward.

They claim that alternative hypotheses, especially the notion that emotions are simply rationalizations of political preferences, better explain the role of emotion in politics. Their ultimate conclusions, however, rest on an overly narrow view of both theory and evidence. Even if one accepts Ladd and Lenz's reanalysis of survey data, there is insufficient evidence to cast aside either AIT or the hypothesis that anxiety affects the mode of political judgment. AIT explains a broad range of political relationships that are unchallenged by the reassessment and which cannot be explained by the offered alternatives. Moreover, numerous experimental studies reject the alternative explanations in favor of an exogenous, often interactive role for anxiety. AIT will surely require amendment, if not abandonment, someday. Competing theories of emotion already exist and, unlike the alternative championed by Ladd and Lenz, these theories too suggest a meaningful role for emotion in political judgment and behavior. For now, given all of the research to date, AIT is a robust competitor, scarcely in need of being ""salvaged.""

Here, we again replicate Marcus, Neuman and MacKuen's (2000)' s voting model, which they contend supports AI, and again show that it is vulnerable to these alternative explanations, regardless of how candidate choice is measured. We also briefly review the broader literature and discuss Brader's (2005, 2006) important experimental results. Although the literature undoubtedly supports other aspects of AI, few studies directly testAVs voting claims, which were the focus of our reassessment. In our view, the only study that does so while ruling out the two alternatives is our analysis of the 1980 ANES Major Panel (Ladd & Lenz, 2008), which finds no support for AI, but ample support for the alternatives.

Political Psychology 32, no. 1 (2011)","In his now-classic research on inoculation theory, McGuire (1964) demonstrated that exposing people to an initial weak counterattitudinal message could lead to enhanced resistance to a subsequent stronger counterattitudinal message. More recently, research on the valence-framing effect (Bizer & Petty, 2005) demonstrated an alternative way to make attitudes more resistant. Simply framing a person's attitude negatively (i. e., in terms of a rejected position such as anti-Democrat) led to more resistance to an attack on that attitude than did framing the same attitude positively (i. e., in terms of a preferred position such as pro-Republican). Using an election context, the current research tested whether valence framing influences attitude resistance specifically or attitude strength more generally, providing insight into the effect's mechanism and generalizability. In two experiments, attitude valence was manipulated by framing a position either negatively or positively. Experiment 1 showed that negatively framed attitudes were held with more certainty than were positively framed attitudes. In Experiment 2, conducted among a representative sample of residents of two U. S. states during political campaigns, negatively framed attitudes demonstrated higher levels of attitude certainty and attitude-consistent behavioral intentions than did attitudes that were framed positively. Furthermore, the effect of valence framing on behavioral intentions was mediated by attitude certainty.

Political Psychology 32, no. 1 (2011)","The partisan realignment of the White South, which transformed this region from being solidly Democratic to being the base of the Republican Party, has been the focus of much scholarship. Exactly how it occurred is unclear. Widespread individual-level attitude changes would be contrary to the well-known within-person stability of party identification. However, according to the impressionable-years hypothesis, events that occur during adolescence and early adulthood may have a lasting impact on later political attitudes. This would suggest that cohort replacement may be driving partisan realignment. We test this possibility using data from the American National Election Studies from 1960 to 2008. Consistent with the impressionable-years hypothesis, Southern Whites from the pre-Civil Rights cohort (born before 1936) maintained their Democratic Party identification longer than their younger counterparts. However, all cohorts in the South have changed their partisan attitudes at comparable rates over time, contrary to the impressionable-years hypothesis. These data suggest that the partisan realignment of the South was driven by both cohort replacement and within-cohort attitude change. More targeted case studies of older cohorts living through the civil rights era, and of younger cohorts in the post-Reagan era, yield results generally consistent with the impressionable-years hypothesis. More generally, our findings suggest that very large scale events are required to disrupt the normal continuity of party identification across the life span.","University of California, Los Angeles",['The University of Michigan']

Implicit and explicit attitudes are related but distinct constructs, and implicit attitudes may have behavioral implications in the political realm.

I find that a Christian religious appeal affects implicit attitudes and political behavior among people who currently or previously identify as Christian.

As predicted, participants primed with the Confederate flag reported less willingness to vote for Obama than those primed with a neutral symbol. The flag did not affect willingness to vote for White candidates. In a second study, participants primed with the Confederate flag evaluated a hypothetical Black target more negatively than controls.

"Craemer, Thomas. ""Possible Implicit Mechanisms of Minority Representation"". Political Psychology 31, no. 6 (2010)","Minority representation is an important topic for political science—how do members of a racial majority group identify with the political goals of a minority, even when research documents widespread anti-Black bias? Does pro-Black policy support require an individual to be unbiased, or can such support emerge despite internalized anti-Black bias? This paper draws a distinction between two types of implicit racial attitude measures based on functionalist theories of attitudes (Katz, 1960; Smith, Bruner, & White, 1956) and research regarding automatic empathie processes (Decety & Jackson, 2004; Preston & de Waal, 2002). According to this distinction, some attitudes evaluate racial groups as attitude objects (evaluative associations), while others involve automatic identification with them as people (relational associations). I use subliminal racial priming for evaluative associations and a measure of implicit closeness to Blacks (Craemer, 2008) for relational associations. The evaluative measure captures association strength between a racial stimulus and raceunrelated positive or negative target words. The relational measure assesses association strength between the respondent's self-concept and the mental representation of a racial group based on implicit ""self-other overlap"" (Awn, Aron, Tudor, & Nelson, 1991). Implicit measures are obtained in a well powered online reaction time study (n = 1,341). Online results are evaluated against a representative telephone survey (n = 1,200). Consistent with the extant literature, a significant anti-Black bias emerges in evaluative associations. In contrast, a significant pro-Black effect emerges in relational associations and the two implicit measures are statistically unrelated. Both measures predict pro-Black policy support independently of one another and net of other factors. Implicit closeness to Blacks predicts pro-Black policy support even among White respondents suggesting that minority representation based on relational associations may be possible despite widespread anti-Black evaluative bias.",University of Connecticut,[]

Here we extend this approach providing clear definitions of these three dimensions as ideological attitude constructs of Authoritarianism, Conservatism, and Traditionalism. These dimensions are seen as attitudinal expressions of basic social values or motivational goals that represent different, though related, strategies for attaining collective security at the expense of individual autonomy. We report data from five samples and three different countries showing that these three dimensions could be reliably measured and were factorially distinct. The three dimensions also differentially predicted interpersonal behaviour, social policy support, and political party support.

A series of small group experiments show that subjects tend to weight expertise more heavily than shared preferences in selecting informants, thereby exposing themselves to diverse views and biased information. Experimental subjects employ several heuristic devices in evaluating the reliability of this information, but depending on their own levels of information, these heuristics often lead subjects either to dismiss advice that conflicts with their own prior judgments or to dismiss advice that comes from an informant with divergent preferences. Hence these heuristics produce important consequences for patterns of political influence, as well as reducing the potential for political change.",Korea University,"['University of California, Davis', 'Florida State University']"

Normatively, new negative information about a preferred candidate should result in a downward adjustment of an existing evaluation. However, recent studies show exactly the opposite; voters become more supportive of a preferred candidate in the face of negatively valenced information. Motivated reasoning is advanced as the explanation, arguing that people are psychologically motivated to maintain and support existing evaluations. Yet it seems unlikely that voters do this ad infinitum. To do so would suggest continued motivated reasoning even in the face of extensive disconfirming information. In this study we consider whether motivated reasoning processes can be overcome simply by continuing to encounter information incongruent with expectations. If so, voters must reach a tipping point after which they begin more accurately updating their evaluations. We show experimental evidence that such an affective tipping point does in fact exist. We also show that as this tipping point is reached, anxiety increases, suggesting that the mechanism that generates the tipping point and leads to more accurate updating may be related to the theory of affective intelligence.

Given the broad theoretical literature on altruistic punishment and group selection as well as our own formal evolutionary model, we hypothesize that it is being a partisan that makes an individual more likely to be a strong reciprocator and not vice versa.",Stony Brook University,"['University of California, San Diego', 'Stanford University', 'University of California, Davis']"

Political Psychology 31, no. 4 (2010)","Despite the widespread use of negative campaigns, research has not yet provided unambiguous conclusions about their effects. So far studies, however, have mainly focused on very explicit measures. The main goal of the present work was to explore the effects of different types of negative campaigns on both implicit and explicit attitudes, as well as in relation to two basic dimensions of social perception, namely competence and warmth. Across a series of three studies, we basically showed that not all negative campaigns lead to the same consequences. Specifically, especially personal attacks toward the opposing candidate may backfire at the explicit level. More interestingly, at an implicit level, the reliance on negative messages was associated with more negative spontaneous affective responses toward the source, but also with a spontaneous conformity to such a source. Overall, it appeared that negative messages decreased the perceived warmth of the source while simultaneously increasing the perceived competence. Results are discussed by focusing on the importance of implicit measures in political psychology and on the crucial role of perceived competence.",University of Padova,[]

Political Psychology 31, no. 3 (2010)","This study draws on a sample of participants in online groups that discussed legalization of same-sex marriage, to examine whether exposure to perceived disagreement decreases—as the deliberative theorists hope—or rather increases—as the research on confirmation bias predicts—strongly held predilections. Overall, participants' views towards same-sex marriage and sexual minority rights remained largely unchanged after deliberating, regardless of the ideological composition of their groups. Consistent with the confirmation bias model, those who strongly opposed same-sex marriage and sexual minority rights prior to the discussions and who perceived that others disagreed with them became even more opposed, and this effect was not a short-term shift. Strong proponents, on the other hand, did not polarize in their views, but instead became slightly less favorable towards same-sex marriage and sexual minority rights as a result of disagreement. Implications of these findings for deliberation of contentious issues are discussed.",IE University,['University of Pennsylvania']

Drawing on Bottici's (2007) philosophical understanding of political myth as a process of work on a common narrative that answers the human need to ground events in significance, it contributes to the study of legitimization in political discourse by examining the role of political myth in official-level U.S. war rhetoric. It explores how two ubiquitous yet largely invisible political myths, American Exceptionalism and Civilization vs. Barbarism, which have long defined America's ideal image of itself and its place in the world, have become staples in the language of the ""War on Terror."" Through a qualitative analysis of the content of over 50 official texts containing lexical triggers of the two myths, this paper shows that senior officials of the Bush Administration have rhetorically accessed these mythical representations of the world in ways that legitimize and normalize the practices of the ""War on Terror.""",University of Colorado at Boulder,[]

Study 3 tested the hypothesis that when identification with a national group conflicts with social expectations it has different, even reversed relations with value priorities. We examined identification of recent immigrants to Israel. The more pressure immigrants felt to assimilate, the more positive the correlation of conservation values with identification with the country of residence (Israel) and the more negative the correlation of conservation values with identification with the country of origin (Russia).

Consistent with recent arguments in cognitive psychology (Fenton-O'Creevy, Nicholson, Soane, & Willman, 2003, 2005), I argue that excessive perceptions of self-efficacy lead some citizens to overestimate their vote's impact in close elections and to vote as a consequence of these perceptions. This illusion of control is further engendered by the features of skill-based activities such as choice, personal involvement, stimulus familiarity, and exertion of effort (Langer, 1975) that are inherent in the act of voting. Employing both cross-sectional and panel data, I find that individuals with high levels of self-efficacy are more likely to be moved to vote by perceptions that an election will be close than are citizens with low levels of self-efficacy.",University of South Carolina,[]

Two studies addressed this issue by contrasting the predictive and discriminant validity of SDO and reworded SDO items assessing prescriptive attitudes toward inequality and dominance based on specific stratifications. Consistent with a global individual difference perspective, SDO predicted systematic between-person consistencies in attitudes toward inequality based on specific group-based stratifications. Moreover, SDO and specific stratification attitudes exerted reciprocal cross-lagged effects on one another over five months (Study 1, N = 252). These results indicate that SDO is partially derived from specific attitudes and experiences (a bottom-up effect), but once formed, SDO exerts a reciprocal (top-down) effect on specific attitudes and cognitions about group-based dominance across a range of stratifications. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that SDO also predicted generalized prejudice toward ethnic groups after controlling for ethnic stratification attitudes (Study 2, N = 138). Taken together, these results indicate that SDO reflects a global motivation to achieve group-based dominance that is partially determined by situational factors but not reducible to self-categorization processes associated with attitudes towards specific social groups or categories.",University of Auckland,['Victoria University of Wellington']

The current paper, however, suggests that a subtle source of influence—polling places themselves—can impact voting behavior. In two elections, people voting in churches were more likely to support a conservative candidate and a ban on same-sex marriage, but not the restriction of eminent domain. A field experiment found that people completing questionnaires in a chapel awarded less money (relative to people in a secular building) to insurance claimants seeking compensation for abortion pills, but not to worker's compensation claimants. A laboratory experiment found that people subliminally exposed to ecclesiastical images awarded less money (relative to people exposed to control images) to abortion pill claimants, but not to worker's compensation claimants. Exposure to ecclesiastical images affected only Christians; non-Christians' awards were unaffected by the prime.

As expected, our findings support the conclusions of Todorov, Mandisodza, Goren, and Hall (2005) by showing a positive correlation between the competence judgments and the real election outcomes. Surprisingly, attractiveness was correlated with losing elections, with the effect being driven by faces of candidates who looked politically incompetent yet personally attractive.

Most studies tend to use efficacy or trust as an independent variable to explain political actions such as voting, campaign involvement, and the like. Despite their importance in explanations of political behavior, relatively little is known regarding mechanisms through which social involvement may influence trust and efficacy. If efficacy and trust are of value, then it is important that we determine how their development can be fostered, and especially whether their development can be promoted through social interaction—such as a sense of community. Borrowing from the field of community psychology, I employ the Sense of Community Index to provide a more nuanced measure of community based on individual perceptions of their community that previous studies were unable to capture. Analyzing original survey data, this paper examines to what extent, if any, a sense of community matters for trust and efficacy. The results demonstrate that social forces, such as community, exert positive and significant effects on internal and external efficacy and personal and political trust, independently of individual traits such as income, age, gender, and education.",University of Tampa,[]

This paper uses annual surveys from the National Survey of American Jews from 2000 through 2005 to address this question. Results indicate a multiplicity of factors affect perceptions of the seriousness of anti-Semitism. Those with a stronger sense of Jewish identity, lower income, and older people are more likely to see anti-Semitism as a very serious problem. Respondents also tend to see anti-Semitism as a more serious threat if they live in states with higher anti-Semitic incidents rates and when use of anti-Semitic terms in the news media increases.

Staff members recall only a small subset of the relevant constituents in the district, and this subset is biased in favor of active and resource-rich constituents over other, equally relevant constituents.

Using data from national probability sample surveys and an experiment, we explored whether SR has effects even when controlling for these potential confounds and whether its effects are specific to policies involving Blacks. Holding constant conservatism and attitudes toward limited government, SR predicted Whites' opposition to policies designed to help Blacks and more weakly predicted attitudes toward social programs whose beneficiaries were racially ambiguous. An experimental manipulation of policy beneficiaries revealed that SR predicted policy attitudes when Blacks were the beneficiary but not when women were.

Prejudice remains and its importance for politics depends, today as in Myrdal's time, on political circumstance: on the vicissitudes of history and the actions of leaders.",University of Michigan,[]

Political Psychology 30, no. 4 (2009)","The conventional wisdom is that racial prejudice remains largely stable through adulthood. However, very little is known about the development of contemporary racial attitudes like symbolic racism. The growing crystallization of symbolic racism through the lifespan is tested using two data sets that measure the stability, consistency, and predictive validity of symbolic racism in samples ranging in age from young adults to the elderly. The results provide evidence that the crystallization of symbolic racism generally takes on a curvilinear trajectory across the lifespan, showing that it is already largely crystallized by voting age, that it continues to crystallize still further through adulthood and that it begins to decline in coherence in late adulthood. The results generally provide evidence confirming early speculations of symbolic racism theorists concerning the crystallization of symbolic racism across the lifespan and are discussed in terms of different theoretical perspectives on the relationship between aging and attitudes more generally.",DePaul University,"['University of California, Los Angeles', 'University of California']"
"Valentino, Nicholas A., Antoine J. Banks, Vincent L. Hutchings, Anne K. Davis. ""Selective Exposure in the Internet Age: The Interaction between Anxiety and Information Utility"". Political Psychology 30, no. 4 (2009)","The rise of the Internet forces scholars to reevaluate the frequency and nature of political information seeking in the contemporary period. The functionality of the Internet makes passive exposure more difficult, and selective information seeking easier, than in the past. However, people may also use the Internet in a new and directed way—to arm themselves with information to express and defend their views either online or in the real world. The central question we explore in this paper is what explains balanced versus biased information seeking in the era of the Internet? We combine insights from Sears and Freedman (1967) with newer work on emotion to predict motivated selectivity: focusing specifically on the interaction between anxiety and information utility. Our central theoretical claim is that anxiety does not simply boost any information seeking; it triggers information seeking that is useful for addressing the problem at hand. Anxiety alone, therefore, does not guarantee a balanced information search. When counterattitudinal information is useful for some reason—for example, to defend their own opinions to others who may disagree—anxious citizens should seek it out. As a consequence, these subjects should learn more specific information about where each candidate stands on the issues. In an experiment we find support for these hypotheses. We conclude that while today's flexible Internet environment may permit selectivity, balanced seeking should still occur under a fairly common set of circumstances.",University of Michigan,['University of Maryland']

The experiments took place during three multisite Deliberative Polls in 2004 and 2005. Participants discussed current political issues within 330 groups of approximately 10 people each.

Theoretically, this paper develops a framework to study the cognitive style of individual central bankers in conjunction with the institutional features of the central banks they head. The paper also controls for a variety of other common explanations for exchange rate volatility during this time period, including the number of veto players representing the political system and underlying structural features of the Asian economies. Empirically, the cross-sectional time-series analysis finds that more conceptually complex central bankers were able to reduce exchange rate volatility during the crisis years, especially when they inhabited highly independent central banks.

This study develops a general theoretical framework for explaining rigidity and flexibility in political leaders by extending insights from classic studies of extreme cases to everyday policymaking and by integrating these findings with more recent theoretical and empirical work in political psychology. The plausibility of hypotheses derived from this framework is investigated by examining the conditions associated with pragmatism and rigidity in 15 cases from the presidency of Ronald Reagan. The results are generally consistent with the proposed model, which stresses person-situation interaction and traces rigidity to the arousal of leaders' sources of self-validation in a particular policy context.

The retributive desires assessed in this article are conceptualized as individual, collective, and abstract demands for the imposition of a commensurate degree of suffering upon the offender. We suggest a plausible way of reducing victims' retributive desires. Instead of ""getting even"" in relation to the suffering, victims and perpetrators may ""get equal"" in relation to their respective statuses, which were affected by political crimes. The article hypothesizes that the three classes of transitional justice: (1) reparation that empowers victims by financial compensation, truth telling, and social acknowledgement; (2) retribution that inflicts punishment upon perpetrators; and (3) reconciliation that renews civic relationship between victims and perpetrators through personal contact, apology, and forgiveness; each contributes to restoring equality between victims and perpetrators, and in so doing decreases the desires that victims have for retribution. In order to test our hypotheses, we conducted a survey of former political prisoners in the Czech Republic. Results from the regression analysis reveal that financial compensation, social acknowledgement, punishment, and forgiveness are likely to reduce victims' retributive desires.",Newcastle University,['Chinese University of Hong Kong']

In Experiment 1, Americans read an article about the war in Iraq that implied Americans would soon experience another attack or one where such implied future threat to the ingroup was absent. When the ingroup's future was threatened, forgiveness for the harm Americans have committed in Iraq was increased, to the extent that collective angst was induced. In Experiment 2, Americans experienced more collective angst and were more willing to forgive their ingroup for their group's present harm doing in Iraq following reminders of either the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, or the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor compared to when the victimization reminder was irrelevant to the ingroup.

While this approach has received extensive critique from reconciliation scholars, its implications for Non-Indigenous involvement in reconciliation have been neglected. When Indigenous disadvantage is divorced from its social and historical context it is also more likely to be seen as having little to do with ""us"" as Non-Indigenous Australians. In contrast, when inequality is seen as stemming from the past and present reality of intergroup relations, and as such shapes the meaning of Non-Indigenous identity, it will be seen as more illegitimate, in need of change, and is more likely to motivate political engagement in the reconciliation process. The current study tests and finds support for this idea. Importantly, controlling for the contributions of perceived legitimacy of inequality and need for social change, Non-Indigenous identity meaning continued to significantly predict intentions to vote and engage in political action in support of reconciliation.",Australian National University,[]

Specifically the study focused on the psychological impact of the ethnopolitical conflict in Northern Ireland, utilizing people's identification with either the Catholic or Protestant community. Our results revealed that intergroup forgiveness mediated the relationship between both victimhood and group identification, as predictors, and mild psychiatric morbidity. Collective guilt, on the other hand, mediated the relationship between both exposure to violence and group identification, as predictors, and intergroup forgiveness. Overall this study shows that forgiveness and collective guilt can act as mediators in the relationship between impact of ethnopolitical conflict and mental health, at the group level, and thus demonstrates their centrality to the reconciliation process.

Political Psychology 30, no. 1 (2009)","This paper explores fear-arousing content in Australian former Prime Minister John Howard's political rhetoric about terrorism. We coded 27 speeches delivered between September 2001 and November 2007 for the presence of statements promoting fear-consistent appraisals (Smith & Lazarus, 1993). Fear-arousing content was present in 24 of these speeches, but the amount of fear-arousing content varied markedly. In particular, rhetoric that raised doubts about the capacity of Australia and its allies to cope with terrorism was most strongly present in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq and at times of declining support for government policies. Textual analysis of three key speeches confirmed a marked difference between Howard's speech given immediately after the attacks on September 11, 2001, and the second and third speeches presented prior to and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. These findings indicate that Howard has not consistently employed fear-inducing rhetoric in his speeches about terrorism, but that particular speeches appear to take this form, raising the possibility that fear-arousing rhetoric may have been selectively deployed to support his political purposes at those times.",The Australian National University,['Murdoch University']

In contrast, people with high levels of political knowledge respond to egalitarianism and individualism questions as if they were opposite ends of a single, liberal-conservative continuum, rather than two of four distinct worldviews.

Political Psychology 30, no. 1 (2009)","In recent years, political scientists have shifted the focus of explaining political phenomena from the purely cognitive perspective to an integrated emotion-cognition one. Yet most studies which examine antecedents of political intolerance ignore the potential role played by ""gut feelings"" or group-based negative emotions in endorsing those attitudes. Moreover, even the few studies that deal with emotions and intolerance concentrate exclusively on the role of groups of emotions (positive vs. negative, dispositional vs. surveillance) or on basic emotions (anger or fear) and ignore the potential influence of more complex discrete emotions like hatred on political intolerance. Hence, the main goal of this study was to create a deeper understanding regarding the role of discrete negative emotions in increasing political intolerance among different groups of individuals in different contexts. In order to do so, the relations between political intolerance and three group-based negative emotions (hatred, anger, and fear) were tested by means of four large-scale nationwide surveys. Within the surveys, various intolerance measurement methods were used in various contexts (wartime vs. no-war/routine periods) and among individuals with different levels of political sophistication. Results, obtained via multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling, show that: (1) Group-based hatred is the most important antecedent of political intolerance even when controlling for important intolerance inducers such as perceived threat. (2) Other group-based negative emotions like anger or fear influence political intolerance wholly through the mediation of hatred or perceived threat. (3) The role of group-based hatred in inducing political intolerance is more substantial in the face of heightened existential threat and among unsophisticated individuals than among sophisticated ones.",Stanford University,"['Yale University', 'Sivan Hirsch-Hoefier', 'University of Antwerp, Belgium']"

Most voting models are built on what voters remember--whether it is the placement of candidates on issues, or opened ended responses to prompts. That recall of memory is biased is well-known, but the extent to which those biases are driven by affective response to candidate information has not been studied. Using dynamic process tracing, we examine voters' emotional responses, information search, and candidate evaluations during a simulated presidential primary campaign. By manipulating anxiety and the amount of incongruent information that voters encounter, we can detect the direct influence of affect in information processing. We find evidence that voters are more likely to remember information that generates any affective reaction as opposed to information for which the subjects report no emotional response. However, we find little evidence that anxiety has a special role, compared to enthusiasm or anger, in increasing the likelihood that an individual item is remembered. This challenges a primary contention of the theory of Affective Intelligence that anxiety leads to more memories for campaign information.",Knox College,['University of Iowa']

Seventy-five years of theory and research on personality and political orientation has produced a long list of dispositions, traits, and behaviors. Applying a theory of ideology as motivated social cognition and a ""Big Five"" framework, we find that two traits, Openness to New Experiences and Conscientiousness, parsimoniously capture many of the ways in which individual differences underlying political orientation have been conceptualized. In three studies we investigate the relationship between personality and political orientation using multiple domains and measurement techniques, including: self-reported personality assessment; nonverbal behavior in the context of social interaction; and personal possessions and the characteristics of living and working spaces. We obtained consistent and converging evidence that personality differences between liberals and conservatives are robust, replicable, and behaviorally significant, especially with respect to social (vs. economic) dimensions of ideology.

Competing hypotheses derived from different theoretical perspectives are empirically evaluated. Social psychological studies of war traditionally highlight a reversal of morality and group norms justifying violence against outgroups. Rationalistic models insist on the importance of realistic costs on the choice of individuals. As a complement to these traditions, we suggest that situations in which risks are generalized across group boundaries tend to provoke a strengthening of principles, such as humanitarian norms, that enable the protection of the material and symbolic integrity of a community. Multilevel analyses of the international People on War survey dataset (N = 8,121) show that support for the ingroup's struggle, at both individual and group levels, predicts stronger justification of violence. Simultaneously, at the context level, generalization of war-related risks predicts stronger condemnation of violations of humanitarian principles.

We explore the degree to which different environments promote or limit ambivalence using a matching approach in conjunction with a set of multilevel models. We find that campaign environments can induce candidate ambivalence. In presidential elections, campaign efforts promote ambivalence most when competition between partisan campaign efforts is high. In House elections, campaign spending has a direct effect on levels of candidate ambivalence, where a candidate's spending decreases ambivalence about that candidate and increases ambivalence about opponents.",Ohio State University,"['University of Colorado, Boulder']"

This paper reconciles these differences by showing how media coverage of the Court can influence procedural perceptions and subsequent support for the Court. Expanding on recent studies examining media coverage of the Court and perceptions of fairness, this study examines how procedural perceptions mediate support for the Court. An experimental design shows that the media's portrayal of procedural information as either fair or unfair influences public evaluations of procedural fairness and subsequently support for the Court as an institution and the individual justices serving on the Court's bench.",Affiliation not found,[]

This paper examines relationships between authoritarianism, on the one hand, and self-identification with ideological labels, attitudes toward political extremists, and party preferences, on the other hand. The survey data have been collected in Hungary between 1994 and 2002. Findings indicate that it is the center-right ideology and political orientation that attracts most authoritarians, yet authoritarian extreme-left also survives. The findings also show that liberal orientation and center-left identification constitute the political counter-pole of authoritarianism. Extreme-right supporters are found to be attracted only to particular aspects of authoritarianism.",University of Twente,['Central European University']

George's seminal contributions in six areas of political psychology and qualitative case study methods. These include George's work on psychological inputs in political processes, the intersection of history and political science, methods of within-case analysis such as process tracing, the use of structured, focused case comparisons (SFCC), the development of typological theories, and the connections among theory, empirical research, teaching, and policy. The article concludes with an analysis of four ongoing dimensions of George's research agenda: the need to integrate theories on purposive, cognitive, social, and motivational dynamics of decision making; the importance of methodological safeguards against our own cognitive biases as researchers; ways of integrating qualitative, quantitative, formal, and experimental research methods; and ways of modeling and testing theories on causal complexity.",Georgetown University,[]

In the process, I highlight other elements of George's theoretically and methodologically integrated research program: his conceptions of the proper role of theory; his emphasis on the infeasibility of a universal theory and the need for conditional generalizations that are historically grounded, sensitive to context, bounded by scope conditions, and useful for policy makers; and the indispensability of process tracing in theoretically driven case studies.",Rutgers University,[]

Among the latter are the influences of our theories and our policy preferences on each other and the possibility that theories can become either self-fulfilling or self-denying prophecies. Less abstractly, following George we then examine prescriptions for better policymaking procedures. This area is plagued by motivated biases because decision makers are responding to powerful political pressures and psychological needs, which means that there are good reasons for them to reject the procedures that scholars advocate. By contrast, unmotivated biases are at work when decision makers adopt inappropriate short-cuts to rationality, and here scholars' help may be more welcome. Furthermore, good social science methods can produce better decisions. But the flow of ideas is not simply one way.

A sample of Bosnian Muslims (N=180) were asked to report their readiness to forgive the misdeeds committed by Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A path analysis of the presumed antecedents and consequences of forgiveness revealed that frequent and good quality contact with members from the perpetrator group predicted forgiveness (positively) and desire for social distance (negatively). Moreover, the positive relationship between contact and forgiveness was mediated by empathy and trust towards the outgroup and by perceived outgroup heterogeneity.

Finally, intergroup forgiveness also predicted social distance from the outgroup.

Second, familiarity with and trust in a party condition cue acceptance. Third, as a whole, minor party labels act as effective cues less consistently than major parties. This finding, we suggest, indicates that there exists some threshold level of familiarity and trust that minor parties must reach in the mass public in order to be effective cues. This research is valuable because it extends current work on party labels as heuristic devices and more general work on cues; our findings are additionally important given recent trends in public opinion data, which indicate that the U.S. public is becoming more accepting of minor parties as permanent features of the political system.",Claremont Graduate University,"['University of Western Ontario', 'University of California, Davis']"
"Craemer, Thomas. ""Nonconscious Feelings of Closeness toward African Americans and Support for Pro-Black Policies"". Political Psychology 29, no. 3 (2008)","In a democratic political system, where decisions are made by majority rule, the permanent exclusion of minorities is always a possibility. This raises a crucial question: what psychological mechanisms may allow members of a majority to identify with the political goals of a minority group? One possibility is that they are precisely the same mechanisms responsible for motivating minority membeers themselves to identify with the minority's political goals. According to the racial attitudes literature, African Americans are motivated by feelings of closeness toward Blacks to support pro-Black policies. This study investigates the possibility that feelings of closeness toward Blacks may also motivate White Americans to support pro-Black policies. To circumvent possible social desirability effects often associated with questions of race, feelings of closeness are measured both on the conscious (explicit) and nonconscious (implicit) levels. The implicit closeness measure is based on the idea of ""cognitive self-other overlap"" (Aron, Aron, Tudor, & Nelson, 1991) and has previously been used to measure nonconscious feelings of closeness in individual relationships. This study represents an application of this measure to the group level of racial intergroup relations. The study is based on a sample of 555 college students of diverse racial backgrounds. Results of a Granger-causality test support the construct validity of the implicit closeness measure. Furthermore, explicit and implicit feelings of closeness toward African Americans predict pro-Black policy support whether White participants are considered alone or together with participants of other backgrounds.

However, the relationship between ethnocentrism and narcissism has rarely been studied, and there is little agreement about what this relationship might be. Both have also been treated as simple, unidimensional constructs, whereas research indicates they are better viewed as complex and multidimensional. New research using multidimensional measures of both constructs was therefore conducted in a sample of 264 undergraduates. Narcissism, primarily its covert form, related positively to intergroup expressions of ethnocentrism, but negatively to intragroup expressions. In addition, both intergroup expressions of ethnocentrism and covert narcissism were related to disliking others. The findings suggest that intergroup expressions of ethnocentrism are based on personal self-aggrandizement, whereas intragroup expressions are based on personal self-transcendence. In addition, they suggest that narcissistic people have generally selfish and exploitative attitudes, even towards their own groups. They also emphasize the importance of investigating both ethnocentrism and narcissism as complex multidimensional constructs.",The Australian National University,['University of Auckland']

It is less reasonable for one's ""incidental"" feelings (e.g., sadness or anger arising from an event in one's personal life) to influence such decisions. In two studies, however, data reveal that incidental anger and sadness do in fact carry over, shaping welfare policy preferences. Study 1 found that incidental anger decreased the amount of welfare assistance participants recommended providing relative to neutral emotion, whereas sadness increased the amount recommended. Study 2 replicated the results and found that limiting participants' cognitive resources eliminated the difference between sadness and anger, thus implying that differences in depth-of-thought drove the effects. In sum, the results reveal ways in which: (a) personal emotions carry over to shape preferences for public policies, (b) emotions of the same valence have opposing effects, and (c) differential depth-of-cognitive-processing contributes to such effects.",University of Pennsylvania,['Harvard University']

Participants were randomly assigned to read a column arguing against mandatory minimum sentencing that employed either a thematic or one of two episodic frames featuring a woman who received a harsh sentence under the policy. Episodic framing was more emotionally engaging. Furthermore, the specific emotions elicited by the episodic frame--sympathy and pity for the woman featured in the column--were associated with increased opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing. Yet the thematic frame was actually more persuasive once this indirect effect of frame on emotional response was taken into account. The results are consistent with the conclusion that framing effects on policy opinion operate through both affective and cognitive channels.

We also hypothesized that a valence manipulation of the ingroup's behavior would cause differences in such support which would be mediated by guilt. In the first study, we manipulated the valence of past ingroup behavior and assessed guilt, dehumanization, and reparation support. As expected, guilt predicted positively and dehumanization negatively participants' support. In addition, guilt partially mediated the manipulation effects on policy support. Consistent with previous research, guilt and dehumanization were unrelated. In Study 2, we assessed individual differences in dehumanization before the manipulation and examined their associations with guilt and reparation support. Initial analyses replicated Study 1. In addition, guilt partially mediated the influence of dehumanization on reparation support. Results suggest that the presence of guilt motivates support for reparation policies, while the absence of guilt explains in part why individual differences in dehumanization inhibit such support.",University of Amsterdam,['University of Kent']

In addition, we speculate that anxiety should improve the quality of information seeking, not just its quantity. In one experiment, we induce emotions directly and find that while anger, enthusiasm, and anxiety can lead people to claim they will pay attention to the campaign, anger actually depresses total information seeking. In a second experiment, we examine the impact of realistic political threats and find that exposure triggers several emotions but that only anxiety boosts information seeking and learning.",University of Texas at Austin,['University of Michigan']

This work generally argues that anxiety affects vote choice indirectly by causing citizens to more thoroughly search for and process political information. This indirect effect of anxiety leads citizens to rely less on heuristics, such as party, and more on substantive information, such as policy positions. The most prominent example of this scholarship is the Affective Intelligence (AI) theory of emotions. In this paper, we use cross-sectional and panel survey data to test AI against two simpler alternatives: (1) that emotions directly influence candidate evaluations and (2) that candidate evaluations directly influence emotions. We first show that these simpler alternatives can produce the complex, cross-sectional interactions that provide the principal support for AI. Then, using panel data to better assess causal direction, we find little support for AI, some evidence that emotions directly influence candidate evaluations, and strong evidence that candidate evaluations directly influence emotions. Scholars, we conclude, should be hesitant to abandon these simpler explanations in favor of AI.",Georgetown University,['Massachusetts Institute of Technology']

Experimental results show that issue framing affects opinion through different psychological processes depending on who the receiver of the frame is. Among the moderately politically aware or those having weak political values, framing effects were mediated through processes of changing importance of considerations as well as changing content of considerations. Among the highly aware, only the importance change process mediated framing effects, while there were no framing effects among those least aware or those having strong values.",Universily of Aarhus,[]

Above and beyond these effects, identification with the coalition positively predicted affect toward allies. Ingroup party affect was positively correlated with affect toward own-coalition party members and own coalition as a whole, but was not negatively associated with affect toward opposing-coalition parties. Moreover, the relationship between own-party affect and affect toward own-coalition party members was mediated by affect toward own coalition.

However, based on individuals' tendency to hold consistent attitudes and to believe that their own political preferences are morally legitimate, it was hypothesized that the direction of the relationship between distrust and competitive foreign policy preferences would depend on which category individuals had in mind: Americans or people. Two correlational studies with American participants were consistent with this hypothesis. Study 1 showed that distrust in Americans versus people had qualitatively different relationships with support for competitive policy preferences (i.e., immigration control, militaristic action). Study 2 found that when the covariance between distrust in Americans and people was controlled, distrust in Americans predicted opposition to torture of suspected terrorists, whereas distrust in people predicted support for torture of suspected terrorists. Moreover, individual discrepancies between distrust in Americans versus people uniquely predicted support for torture. Finally, mediational analyses in both studies indicated that political conservatism explained the effects between distrust in Americans versus people and competitive policy preferences. It is argued that distrust in Americans and distrust in people are distinct but complementary bases of Americans' moral-political reasoning.","University of California, Los Angeles",[]

Specifically, we find that ambivalence tends to be greater among the well informed and those who are high in need for cognition while it tends to be lower among those motivated by directional goals. Collectively, our results suggest that levels of partisan and candidate ambivalence are greatest among those most likely to engage in effortful processing of information and that these effects are independent of value conflict. The results further suggest that the effects of effortful processing on ambivalence are moderated by attitude commitment.",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,[]

Political Psychology 28, no. 5 (2007)","The paper investigates the relationships between motivated social cognition (need for cognitive closure), personal worldviews (traditional, modern, or postmodern), and conservative political beliefs. The relationships were analyzed in a sample of 189 Polish adults. High need for closure was associated with support for both traditional and modern worldviews. Although different in content (i.e., endorsing different values and assumptions about the methods and limits of cognition), the worldviews share similar formal characteristics: Both assume the absolute nature of values and the existence of definite truths. However, acceptance of the traditional worldview was related to political conservatism (i.e., support for nationalist and isolationist opinions and a stronger role for traditional, religious values in public life), whereas acceptance of the modern worldview was associated with a rejection of conservative political beliefs. Moreover, personal worldviews mediated the relationship between need for closure and political beliefs: Support for social conservatism was mediated by acceptance of the traditional worldview, whereas acceptance of the modern worldview predicted rejection of conservative values.","Middlesex University, UK","['Warsaw School of Social Psychology, Poland', 'Institute of Psychology, Polish Academy of Sciences']"

Based on the Five Factor Model of Personality, we state hypotheses regarding the effects of personality traits on partisan attitudes and vote choice in Germany. We test the hypotheses using survey data obtained from a random sample of the Germans eligible to vote. The evidence confirms that personality traits indirectly affect partisan attitudes and voting behavior in Germany in predictable ways even after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. More specifically, Openness makes citizens more inclined to support parties endorsing social liberalism whereas low scores on Conscientiousness increase the likelihood of liking and voting for parties subscribing to economic or social liberalism as do high levels on Agreeableness.

This embodiment often occurs as personification, where the state is associated with the most salient figure in the political system, but embodiment can also occur through political institutions and social groups. Surprisingly, there is virtually no systematic empirical work on the political and psychological consequences of state personification, or other forms of embodiment. In this experiment, we investigate how various ways of embodying the state influence attitude formation processes. Drawing on the on-line/memory-based processing and entitativity literatures, we hypothesize that personification of the state should facilitate on-line processing and stronger attitudes, whereas embodying the state as a parliamentary institution should produce weaker attitudes that are formed in a memory-based fashion. The results support these hypotheses. Embodiment as a social group produced inconsistent results. This study provides the first systematic evidence that the widespread practice of personification of the state has robust and potentially far-reaching attitudinal consequences that have meaningful implications for strategic interaction, perception and learning, and attitude change in the international realm.",The Ohio State University,[]

The motivational goal for ingroup conformity and collective security indexed by RWA, in contrast, changed as a function of the degree to which the social world was perceived as a dangerous and threatening place prone to high levels of crime and immoral behavior. These findings are consistent with the causal pathways between social worldviews and ideological attitudes predicted by Duckitt's (2001) model of the dual motivational and cognitive processes underlying prejudice.

Results suggest a tendency for presidents' integrative complexity to be higher at the beginning of their first term and drop at the end. This pattern was pronounced for presidents who eventually won reelection to a second term and was markedly different for presidents who tried to gain reelection but lost. Additional analyses suggested that presidents' overall integrative complexity scores were in part accounted for by chronic differences between presidents' complexity levels. Further analyses revealed that this overall integrative complexity score was positively correlated to a set of interpersonal traits (friendliness, affiliation motive, extraversion, and wittiness) and negatively correlated with inflexibility.

Previous work on emotions and prosocial tendencies has focused on empathy. In the context of post-war Iraq, we found that while empathy predicted support for a number of different political actions that have the potential to advance the welfare of the Iraqi people (humanitarian action in particular), guilt over the U.S. invasion was an important predictor of support for reparative actions (i.e., restoring damage created by the U.S. military), and moral outrage toward Saddam Hussein and his regime was the best predictor of support for political actions to prevent future harm to the Iraqi people and to punish the perpetrators. Our findings demonstrate the utility of an emotion-specific framework for understanding why and what type of political actions individuals will support. And in contrast to the traditional view that emotions are an impediment to rationality, our findings suggest that they can serve as a potentially powerful vehicle for motivating political engagement among the citizenry.","University of California, Los Angeles",[]

Since that time the level of violence in Northern Ireland has reduced but many problematic issues related to governance, sectarianism, and community relations remain on the political agenda and have destabilized the post-peace accord environment. Many of these issues can be viewed as either causes or consequences of the protracted conflict in Northern Ireland. This special issue examines some of these issues from a political psychology perspective. Economic, political, social, and psychological factors that have supported and hindered progress towards peace and stability are considered. While the paramilitary ceasefires have remained intact and certain aspects of life in Northern Ireland have been transformed, the road to peace has been hindered by both political and psychological intransigence.

This complicates macrosocial explanations of the conflict which make specific predictions on the basis of minority or majority positions. The present paper argues that this conundrum may have arisen from the inherent variability in microidentity processes that do not fit easily with macroexplanations. In this paper the rhetoric of relative group position is analysed in political speeches delivered by leading members of an influential Protestant institution in Northern Ireland. It is apparent that minority and majority claims are not fixed but are flexibly used to achieve local rhetorical goals. Furthermore, the speeches differ before and after the Good Friday Agreement, with a reactionary ""hegemonic"" Unionist position giving way to a ""majority-rights power sharing"" argument and a ""pseudo-minority"" status giving way to a ""disempowered minority"" argument.

A ""black exceptionalism"" hypothesis suggests instead that the color line will be more porous for them, allowing for greater assimilation over successive generations, including a gradual weakening of politicized racial and ethnic group consciousness. Using data from Los Angeles County Social Surveys, we find that the largest new immigrant group, Latinos, like blacks, show strongly group-interested policy preferences and strong group consciousness. However, both effects are stronger for recent Latino immigrants than for the U.S.-born. We conclude that the new immigrant groups are increasingly likely to assimilate politically into the broader society in future generations, whereas a rather strict color line will continue to restrict blacks and maintain their distinctiveness.","University of California, Los Angeles",['University of California']

It is even more difficult to determine whether beliefs are powerful in the sense of determining behavior and autonomous in the sense of not being directly derivable from other factors.

In this article, I test hypotheses linking group identities with intolerance, based on a 2001 survey in South Africa, a country where group identities have long been politicized. My empirical findings indicate that group identities are not useful predictors of South African intolerance. Indeed, for neither the black majority nor the white minority do ingroup identities activate very much outgroup intolerance. Moreover, group identities are positively, not negatively, correlated with holding a South African national identity.

Citizens are expected to sanction politicians for those policy decisions over which their level of government has responsibility. This paper draws on work in both political and social psychology to develop a theoretical framework consistent with the federalist view of democratic representation to explain how people make voting decisions. Individuals who were able to vote in elections at all three levels of government (national, state, and local) in 2002 were surveyed, allowing a full test of the federalist voting model. Findings show that while citizens do make distinctions among levels of government when evaluating issues, they only link these distinctions to their voting decisions if those issue attitudes are highly accessible.

In the Dutch context, each group is a minority, whereas in the Turkish context the Kurds are an oppressed national minority and the Turks are the national majority. The results showed that the Turks were less in favor of minority rights in the Turkish context than in the Dutch context, whereas the Kurds were more in favor of minority rights in the Turkish than in the Dutch context. In addition, the endorsement of minority rights was related to beliefs about majority rule, state unity, and ingroup identification, as well as to cultural diversity and perceived pervasive discrimination. The associations with the former three measures differed between the two groups and the two national contexts, whereas the latter two measures had main effects on the endorsement of minority rights.",Utrecht University,"['Ali Asian Yildiz', 'University of Bonn']"

Following the manipulation, stereotypes and conflict-relevant attitudes were assessed. Results revealed that when Sinhalese participants were inclined to think of their group as the outnumbered minority, stereotypic perceptions of Tamils were more demonizing (i.e., depicting Tamils as more malevolent and also more competent), and their conflict-relevant attitudes were less conciliatory. These results have conceptual implications as well as implications for understanding conflict and conflict resolution.",University of British Columbia,['University of Peradeniya']

The research consisted in studying 20 small groups of parents of school-aged children who were asked to participate in a debate about sex education in Polish schools (N = 195). The debates were conducted by a facilitator. Before and after the debate participants filled out questionnaires testing their attitudes and some psychological variables.

New research in the cognitive sciences suggests that this reliance on conscious considerations provides but a partial picture of how citizens think and reason. Given the limitations of conscious working memory and the growing evidence that much of human cognition occurs outside of awareness, the defining empirical assumption of modern public opinion research-that citizens can tell us what is on their minds-seems increasingly suspect. Moreover, social science is particularly challenged by the sensitivity of their topics, which in turn raises social and personal desirability concerns about self-report data. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose an implicit experimental approach. We contend that implicit measures enable us to measure some of the automatic and affective responses and predispositions that influence thoughts and behaviors outside of conscious awareness.",Stony Brook University,[]

This study utilized an innovative survey technique, the factorial survey methodology (Rossi & Nock, 1982), which allows for the simultaneous experimental manipulation of a large number of factors through the use of a vignette. This research demonstrates how the portrayal of difficulties faced by people in need and the ways in which they attempt to overcome these difficulties affect support for policies designed to aid low-income individuals and families. In addition, this study of public attitudes considers the role that psychological orientations of the evaluators play in judgments of families in need. In this case, we examined how the evaluators' belief that the world is a just place influences their evaluations of deservingness. Consistent with our expectations, we found that the more efforts the vignette subject engaged in improving her situation, the less deserving of government benefits she was judged to be by respondents with a strong belief in a just world. The reverse was found among respondents with a weaker belief: more efforts were associated with greater judgments of deservingness.","Center for Women and Work, Rutgers University","['Columbia University', 'New York University']"

However, observing such differences among subjects with diverse political orientations is not enough to prove the existence of an organic link between social differentiation and the representations of delinquency. The aim of this paper is to provide an experimental proof of such a link. The results show that: (a) right-wing and left-wing subjects tend to offer different types of explanations of delinquency, but they refer to several common organizing principles; (b) divergence increases when social comparison between groups is activated; (c) differences are bigger if this comparison induces a discrimination; (d) the bigger the differences the more likely are the groups to resort to their ideological principles.

I show that the public did respond positively to the multifaceted compromise and that black flag opponents were much more likely than white flag proponents to support the compromise. I also show that more white flag proponents can be swayed to support the compromise if they understand that it is supported by a majority of South Carolinians, thus breaking their misperception of the issue. Flag proponents, however, do not respond more positively to compromise simply because it is the by-product of white and black negotiations.

Low-complexity individuals drew analogies solely from their own generational and cultural context, while high-complexity leaders drew their analogies from a wider range of sources.

The predictions from this theory are tested using a battery of tolerance items asked repeatedly in General Social Surveys gathered between 1976 and 2000. The analysis shows that the intellectual campaign against hate speech has significantly reduced support for the free speech rights of racists. This retreat in levels of tolerance is most evident among college students who were educated since the mid-1980s, when dabates over multiculturalism and political correctness reached their peak. At the same time, levels of tolerance for nonconformist ideas and lifestyles have remained generally high among today's college students and are almost always significantly higher than the national average.

To overcome these problems, they recommend that a Medical Advisory Commission be established at the outset of every presidential administration to examine the president annually and then provide formal medical input so that the vice president and cabinet would be ""compelled"" to act in the presence of medically determined ""inability,"" whether physiological or psychological. This paper argues, however, that such a proposal is badly flawed and quite unworkable, particularly in the case of psychological illness where accurate diagnosis typically depends on long-term, continuous doctor-patient interaction rather than through sporadic and superficial interchange.

Comparisons were made between four U.S. groups: White natives, White immigrants, Black/Latino natives, and Black/Latino immigrants. Groups differed in their endorsement of social diversity and social inequality, as well as in their orientation toward collective action and their ethnic group identification. For all groups, ethnic identity mediated the link between ideology and collective action, but the valence and magnitude of paths differed as a function of ethnicity and immigrant status.

In contrast, research on political leadership and decision making suggests that leaders vary systematically in their orientations toward constraints: ""constraint respecters"" tend to internalize potential constraints, while ""constraint challengers"" are more likely to view them as obstacles to be overcome. This article develops an integrative theoretical framework that explicitly incorporates these insights and applies them to the domain of crisis decision making. After identifying leaders' expected orientations toward constraints via at-a-distance methods, the plausibility of hypotheses derived from this framework is examined through case studies that explore the decision-making processes employed by President Kennedy (a ""constraint respecter"") and President Reagan (a ""constraint challenger"") during international crises. The results suggest that there is important variation in how leaders perceive and respond to domestic constraints, and that leadership style is one-though not the only-important source of this variation.",James Madison University,[]

Political Psychology 26, no. 6 (2005)","This study examines how frames invoking a core value shape the content and quantity of citizens' thoughts about a policy issue. An experimental study showed that exposure to a pro-school voucher equality frame increased the probability that participants would invoke equality in their open-ended survey responses. Exposure to an anti-school voucher equality frame produced the same effect, as did exposure to both frames. At the same time, participants who received either frame or both frames provided fewer open-ended responses. Thus, the frames appeared to focus participants' thoughts on one value while reducing the overall extent to which they thought about the issue. In broader terms, value framing may have implications for the nature and quality of public deliberation about policy issues-a point that scholars should keep in mind when considering how to define and study framing effects.",University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,['George Washington University']

We argue that affective processes, in addition to generating feeling states, also influence how political cognition is manifested. Drawing on the theory of affective intelligence, we examine the role that anxiety plays in how and when people rely on predispositions and when they rely on contemporaneous information in making political tolerance judgments. We report on two experimental studies to test our arguments. In the first study we find that extrinsic anxiety generates a resistance response among subjects who hold a strong predisposition and a receptive response among those who do not. In the second study we present subjects with explicit ""frames"" exposing them to a pro- or anti-free speech message. We find that extrinsic anxiety enhances responsiveness to frames while an absence of anxiety diminishes the impact of these frames. Taken together these results show that affective processes shape how people make political judgments.",Williams College,"['University of Minnesota', 'University of Nebraska', 'Hartwick College']"

Political Psychology 26, no. 5 (2005)","Supporters and opponents of affirmative action are often characterized as debating about a single, consensually understood type of affirmative action. However, supporters and opponents instead may have different types of policies in mind when thinking about affirmative action and may actually agree on specific manifestations of affirmative action policies more than is commonly believed. A survey conducted using a student sample and a sample from the broader Chicago-area community showed that affirmative action policies can be characterized into merit-violating versus merit-upholding manifestations. Supporters of affirmative action in general were more likely to think of affirmative action in its merit-upholding manifestations, whereas opponents were more likely to think of the merit-violating manifestations. However, both supporters and opponents showed more support for merit-upholding rather than merit-violating manifestations of affirmative action. The same pattern of results was upheld even when splitting the samples into those who endorsed negative racial attitudes versus those who did not, suggesting that even those who may be considered racist will endorse affirmative action policies that uphold merit values. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of clarifying the political discourse about what affirmative action is and what it is designed to do.",DePaul University,[]

This raises questions about what might inhibit the racialization of welfare attitudes. In this vein, a long line of work indicating that education leads to increased tolerance suggests that the relationship between negative racial perceptions and welfare attitudes may be weaker among the highly educated. However, recent studies suggest that the role of education may be more complex: While negative racial perceptions may be less prevalent among the highly educated, the relationship between these perceptions and policy attitudes appears to be stronger among highly educated individuals. The present study attempts to extend this finding by examining the hypothesis that the presence of a racial cue would be more (rather than less) likely to strengthen the relationship between negative racial perceptions and evaluative responses to welfare among college-educated Whites. Data from a survey-based experiment included in the 1991 National Race and Politics Study provided a clear pattern of support for this hypothesis.","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",[]

The earlier work on political churches has established the importance of these organizations for voter turnout and other forms of political participation. What has been left unexamined is the nature of the political churches themselves. This project disentangles these churches by looking at the heterogeneity within the structures of the political churches. In general, we seek to understand which of the internal activities of the political church tend to foster acts of political participation. We hypothesize that cost-underwriting activities and obligation-creating activities within the church setting have the greatest impact on participation. By examining a robust and expansive operationalization of the political church construct, we find that these types of political church activities matter more than other activities. In specifying how churches may work to directly affect the participation of their members, we seek to expand the scope of general comprehension of political churches.",The Ohio State University,['University of Texas at Austin']

We find that while life-cycle effects explain a portion of the movement away from the two major parties, generational effects account for the small but significant increase in Republican party identification in the youngest generation. Additionally, living in the South accounts for the steepest gains in political independence. Finally, changing economic influences over time appear to have led poorer Blacks to change from the most likely to the least likely to identify with a major party.",Polimetrix,"['University of California, Berkeley']"

A psychodynamic explanation for these patterns was then offered. This study also developed an instrument for evaluating leadership styles in a cabinet system of government and postulated the theoretical links between personality patterns and leadership style profiles. Gandhi's leadership style was then examined and links between personality profile and leadership style explored: In eight of the 10 leadership categories, Indira Gandhi's leadership behavior matched our expectations for the Ambitious, Dominant, and Contentious personality profiles but not the Reticent one. Further discussion focused on the two areas in which personality patterns fell short of predicting leadership style and the possible explanations for this result.",Affiliation not found,[]

Positive attitudes toward compromise were associated with feelings of sympathy toward Palestinians, but, surprisingly, attitudes toward compromise were not associated with feelings of fear toward Palestinians. The possibility is advanced that it is fear of harm to the group, not fear of harm to self and family, that is related to willingness to compromise.

Social dominance theorists have described terror mostly as a tool for maintaining intergroup hierarchies in society (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Although implications of the theory suggest that terror may also be used by lower status groups as a tool for the resistance of domination by higher status groups, this prediction heretofore has not been empirically demonstrated. Data from two samples, one in the United States and one in Lebanon, were collected regarding attitudes toward terrorism and intergroup violence. The results show that the American sample demonstrates the typical patterns of social dominance such that those who are higher in social dominance orientation tend to support greater violence toward the Middle East. However, the Lebanese sample shows the opposite pattern, such that those who are lower in social dominance orientation tend to support violence toward the West. These results suggest that (1) support for terrorism among Middle East citizens is a project of counter-dominance, and, more broadly, that (2) the relationship between social dominance orientation and support for violence depends on the dynamics of the conflict and the status of the perpetrators.",DePaul University,"['University of California, Los Angeles', 'Claremont McKenna College', 'University of Connecticut']"

We present findings from a study conducted in 1998 that examined the impact of democratic civic education among South African high school students. Using a battery of items to gauge democratic orientations, including measures of political knowledge, civic duty, tolerance, institutional trust, civic skills, and approval of legal forms of political participation, we find that civic education had the largest effects on political knowledge, with the magnitude of the effect being approximately twice as large as the recent Niemi and Junn (1998) finding for the United States. Exposure to civic education per se had weaker effects on democratic values and skills; for these orientations, what matters are specific factors related to the quality of instruction and the use of active pedagogical methods employed by civics instructors. Further, we find that civic education changed the structure of students' orientations: a ""democratic values"" dimension coalesces more strongly, and in greater distinction, from a ""political competence"" dimension among students exposed to civic education than among those with no such training. We discuss the implications of the findings for our theoretical understanding of the role of civic education in fostering democratic attitudes, norms, and values, as well as the practical implications of the results for the implementation and funding of civic education programs in developing democracies in the future.",University of Virginia,['U.S. Naval Academy']

Students already inclined to serve scored high on all measures throughout and showed no advantage after meeting the requirement. However, students who were less inclined to serve showed marked gains on three of four civic measures after completing their requirement. Whereas they scored as low as their less-inclined counterparts who had no requirement during grade 11, they differed from their counterparts after serving the mandated 40 hours during grade 12.

We conclude with a discussion of the ""so what?"" question-the conceptual, substantive, and normative implications of hot cognition for political judgments, evaluations, and choice.

Thus, group authoritarianism provides a perspective according to which personality characteristics and general psychological mechanisms described by Social-Identity Theory (SIT) and Self-Categorization Theory (SCT) interact in predicting intergroup hostility and intergroup discrimination.

Political Psychology 26, no. 2 (2005)","A basic pattern of human response to stressful and uncertain situations which provoke anxiety and insecurity is to seek security and shelter. Those who provide support become by a process of psychological attribution authorities. Therefore the mechanism of seeking support and shelter under strained conditions might be called an ""authoritarian reaction."" Socialization involves a negotiation with this basic reaction of flight in situations of uncertainty. As individuals develop, they learn to overcome the authoritarian reaction by formulating their own strategies to cope with reality. The authoritarian personality emerges out of an inability to generate such individual coping strategies. Authoritarian personalities defer to the dictates and control of others who offer them the certainty and comfort they cannot provide for themselves. Extensions of this basic authoritarian response are the rejection of the new and the unfamiliar, rigid adherence to norms and value systems, an anxious and inflexible response to new situations, suppressed hostility, and passive aggression. A new measure based on items on one's own behavior, feelings, motivation, and the individual's concept of the self was developed and tested in several empirical studies.

Participants also tended to perceive the United States as having relatively superior power, inferior cultural status, and goals that are incompatible with those of Lebanon. Consistent with image theory predictions, this constellation of structural perceptions was associated with stronger endorsement of the barbarian image. Furthermore, participants were more likely to endorse the barbarian image of the United States the more they identified with Arabs and Palestinians, the less they identified with Christians and the Western world, and the lower their social dominance orientation.

This suggests that the issue of crime may be implicitly ""racialized,"" despite a lack of overt racial content. The present study examines the hypothesis that education may weaken the relationship between negative racial perceptions and crime-related policy attitudes. In contrast to traditional views about the role of education in the domain of race-related attitudes, the results of analyses using several different general-population samples suggest that the effects of education are somewhat paradoxical: they reduce the intensity of negative racial perceptions, while bolstering the relationship between these perceptions and criminal justice attitudes.","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",[]

Political Psychology 26, no. 1 (2005)","This article evaluates the predictive value of a new theory for understanding public support for alternative solutions to policy problems, which we call policy metaphors. A policy metaphor represents a particular form of cognitive framing that makes use of commonly understood social institutions and judgments about their effectiveness to form ""arche-types"" against which proposed solutions to new policy problems are compared. We test the extent to which both understanding of and preference for particular policy frames predicts the nature and strength of policy choices by a representative sample of the American public. After controlling for factors that past research has shown to be important in understanding public opinion, including general partisan and ideological attitudes, self-interest, political values, and emotions, the cognitive frames specified by the general theory of policy metaphors are shown to strongly predict public support for hypothetical solutions to three different policy problems. These frames also predict support for President Clinton's 1993-94 health care reforms after controlling for those same conventional predictors. Most importantly, we demonstrate that these cognitive frames help constrain the beliefs of even the least politically aware members of the general public. Discussion centers on the implications of this new approach for understanding public opinion.",Rutgers University,['Yale University and Rutgers University']

Theoretical distinctions were drawn between two forms of identity content: traditional-cultural and civic, and between two forms of relational orientation: blind and constructive. The multidimensionality of both identity content and relational orientation and the relationships amongst these components were examined in a British sample: positive relationships were hypothesized between blind orientation and traditional-cultural content and between constructive orientation and civic content. Principal components analyses confirmed the hypothesized factor structures, and the resulting scales were highly reliable. Relationships amongst the resulting factors were explored using regression analyses. The overall results indicate support for the orthogonality of both the two orientation dimensions and the two content dimensions. Moreover, the hypothesized relationships between forms of orientation and content were largely supported. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of looking at the relationship between identity content and relational orientation.

System justification theory is influenced by these perspectives-including social identity and social dominance theories-but it departs from them in several respects. Advocates of system justification theory argue that (a) there is a general ideological motive to justify the existing social order, (b) this motive is at least partially responsible for the internalization of inferiority among members of disadvantaged groups, (c) it is observed most readily at an implicit, nonconscious level of awareness and (d) paradoxically, it is sometimes strongest among those who are most harmed by the status quo. This article reviews and integrates 10 years of research on 20 hypotheses derived from a system justification perspective, focusing on the phenomenon of implicit outgroup favoritism among members of disadvantaged groups (including African Americans, the elderly, and gays/lesbians) and its relation to political ideology (especially liberalism-conservatism).","Department of Psychology, New York University","['Department of Psychology and Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study,', 'Harvard University', 'Department of Psychology, University of Virginia']"

More specifically, to the extent that self-categories shape social action, flexibility is achieved through the categories to which we belong, the others with whom we compare ourselves, and the dimensions along which such comparisons occur.

Political Psychology 25, no. 6 (2004)","The current forum is designed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of social identity, social dominance, and system justification as theoretical approaches to the study of intergroup relations. Each of these approaches tries to account for variation in the development of ingroup cohesion and outgroup antipathy among individual group members, across groups, and in different societies-three levels at which theorists have commonly sought explanations for variability in intergroup attitudes and behavior. Social dominance theory is the most ambitious of the theories but does not succeed in explaining intergroup relations equally well at all three levels. However, it has excelled in highlighting individual differences in the need and desire to dominate members of lower-status groups and in exploring the interaction between individuals and institutions. Social identity theory is primarily concerned with the attributes of groups that foster the development of ingroup bias and examines the conditions under which this occurs. It is more fully developed in this respect than the other approaches but ignores variation at the individual level and, to a lesser degree, the societal level. System justification theory considers a mix of individual-and societal-level factors, focusing on the role of support for the status quo in producing acceptance of status inequalities among members of low-status groups, even when it is against their own interest to do so. The theory highlights an important problem-the quiescence of low-status groups-but more work is needed to flesh out the theory and its central concepts.",Affiliation not found,[]

Company (rather than privacy, property, or political participation) stands out as the basic right, and all the other rights follow on it as instruments for fulfilling it.

Exit refers to a desire to emigrate and can be construed as apolitical, private, and passive-a threat to citizenship-whereas Voice refers to political commitment and can be construed as ideal citizenship. A survey of 560 Bulgarian university students in 1998 explored their emphasis on Exit and Voice (as options for themselves in the future) and the association of each option with different economic, political, and psychological factors. One in four students wanted to emigrate, and half of them considered leaving the country for a period of time. Exit plans appeared mainly to be triggered by a wish to participate in the consumer culture, but were also associated with a critical view of the political system as well as a rejection of tradition in conjunction with a Western identity. Although most of the students shared vague or ideal Voice-related plans, few wanted to become actively involved in politics. An emphasis on Voice reflected not only a somewhat limited political engagement but also a more traditionalistic attitude associated with plans for a career and family. The findings indicate that a normative separation between Exit and Voice as theoretical concepts does not cover the complexities of the Bulgarian students' emigration and political involvement plans.","and SINTEF Health Research, Trondheim, Norway",[]

This study speculates about the types of appeals that incumbents and challengers find most effective and that are, as a result, most likely to dominate an election campaign. Candidates have an incentive to use arguments that evoke emotions such as fear, anxiety, and anger. Emotional appeals allow candidates to emphasize consensual values, which makes it easier to mobilize their party's base while simultaneously attracting the support of the uncommitted. The use of emotional appeals is also consistent with the media's preference for drama and excitement in news reporting. Thus, emotional appeals will be more enduring than other types of appeals, and hence more likely to dominate the rhetorical landscape.

In this case, the logic of prospect theory better captures how actors made decisions about whether or not to engage in collective action. Of the four groups that did join the 1973-75 economic coalition, only one (the mineowners) appears to have maximized its net asset level, as expected utility theory predicts. All four groups seem to have been motivated to cooperate because they found themselves in the domain of losses and expected that cooperation with other, even rival, economic groups might help them recoup their recent losses.",Mershon Center; Ohio State University,[]

Experimental findings suggest the degree of effort required to obtain compliance in comparable deterrence and compellence situations. Deterrence is ""easier"" than compellence, but this relationship is variable.

These negotiations were ultimately carried to the highest levels of government, discussed at international conferences, and even ruled on by the World Trade Organization, yet estimates of the potential market for foreign apples never exceeded $15 million. Such protracted negotiations in this sector do not make sense from the perspective of expected utility theory but can be explained by prospect theory. Apple negotiations came to represent a spiral model for both the United States and Japan.

This paper investigates whether different frames also lead to different patterns of emotional response. Cognitive appraisal models of emotion suggest that frames can alter emotional reactions. An experiment compared students' emotional responses to versions of a newspaper article that emphasized underlying social conditions as the cause of the 1992 Los Angeles riots (situational frame) or emphasized irresponsibility and criminality on the part of the rioters (dispositional frame). Few systematic framing effects were found when examining whether respondents reported experiencing a particular emotion. However, consistent with recent work showing that predispositions mediate the effect of frames on opinion, frames altered the relationship between predispositions and emotion. Patterns suggestive of framing effects also emerged in an examination of the content of people's emotional reactions. The findings are consistent with the claim that framing affects emotional responses, reinforce the claim that framing effects depend on individual predispositions, and underscore the importance of accounting for the content of people's emotional responses in the study of emotion.","School of Media and Public Affairs, George Washington University","['AgeLab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology']"

Political Psychology 25, no. 1 (2004)","Social dominance orientation (SDO) is a measure of general desire for group-based dominance. According to social dominance theory, the higher the status of one's group, the higher one's level of SDO should be. This study examined the extent to which between-group differences in SDO increase as the size of the perceived status gap between the groups increases. Data were collected in Israel, Northern Ireland, and the United States. In agreement with expectations, differences in SDO between arbitrary-set groups (e.g., ethnic and religious groups) were found to be greater when the status gap between the groups was perceived to be larger. In contrast, gender differences in SDO did not vary as a function of the size of the perceived status gap between men and women: Men had higher levels of SDO than women even when the gender status gap was perceived to be very small. These findings highlight the effects of perceived group status on SDO and the degree to which these effects vary depending on whether the salient group distinction is based on gender, ethnicity, or religion.","Department of Psychology, Claremont McKenna College",[]

Political Psychology 25, no. 1 (2004)","The decision to vote in a national election requires a choice between serving a social good and satisfying one's self-interest. Viewed as a cooperative response in a social dilemma, casting a vote seems irrational because it cannot have a discernible effect on the electoral outcome. The findings of two studies with undergraduate samples suggest that some people vote not because they set aside self-interest, but because they expect their own behaviors to matter. Two psychological processes contribute to this belief: the voter's illusion (the projection of one's own choice between voting and abstention to supporters of the same party or candidate), and the belief in personal relevance (the belief that one's own vote matters regardless of its predictive value for the behavior of others). The rationality of these two egocentric mechanisms depends on the normative framework invoked. Their relevance for actual voting behavior is indicated by their ability to account for four types of variation in turnout rates.","Department of Psychology, University of Miami","['Department of Psychology, Brown University']"

The present study explores the effects of damage to the right-hemisphere somatosensory cortices (RSS), a region known for its role in emotion recognition. Seven subjects with RSS damage were shown a short movie depicting objects that move in socially suggestive ways, a stimulus that typically elicits spontaneous social and emotional attributions from normal subjects. The spontaneous verbal responses of RSS-damaged subjects to this movie were compared to those of normal subjects as well as brain-damaged control subjects; the data were derived using a word count and categorization computer program. This method measures spontaneous social and emotional judgments rather than the more typical rating and labeling measures used in neuropsychological studies of social judgment. As predicted, relative to brain-damaged and normal controls, subjects with RSS damage reacted to the stimulus movie with fewer words in categories describing emotional and social processes, despite using a similar total number of words (and slightly more words describing movement, a control category). These results provide further evidence for the role of the RSS in social/emotional processing and identify a role for the RSS in automatic representation in ourselves of body states of others to foster emotion recognition and social cognition.","Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Iowa","['Iowa College of Medicine', 'Humanities and Social Sciences, California Institute of Technology', 'Department of Psychology, University of Texas at Austin']"

This technique may also prove useful in studying implicit social attitudes and their effects on information processing. Here, ERPs were used in a study of ""hot cognition"" in the context of political concepts. Hot cognition, as applied to the political domain, posits that all sociopolitical concepts that have been evaluated in the past are affectively charged, and that this affective charge is automatically activated from long-term memory within milliseconds of presentation of the political stimulus. During an evaluative priming task, ERP recordings showed that affectively incongruent prime/target pairs elicited an enhanced negativity with a peak latency of about 400 milliseconds relative to affectively congruent prime/target pairs. These differences suggest that automatic, implicit evaluations were made in response to strongly positive and negative political stimuli, and that these evaluations affected the subsequent processing of a high-valence adjective. Therefore, it appears that the emotional valence of a political prime is stored along with the concept itself, and that an affective response becomes active upon mere exposure to the political stimulus.","Department of Psychology, State University of New York at Stony Brook",['Charles S.

Several hundred undergraduates in each study were randomly assigned to one of two media frames. In the 1998 study, the political scandal was depicted as a matter of sexual indiscretion by the president or as legal wrongdoing; in the 1999 study, the recently concluded impeachment process was depicted as the consequence of partisanship or of Clinton's actions. The participants' judgments of media influence on themselves and on the public were then recorded. The results show that third-person effects were sensitive to issue framing, but change occurred primarily in participants' judgments about their own vulnerability to media influence.","Department of Political Science, University of Kansas",[]

What are the consequences of ambivalence and uncertainty for candidate evaluation? The results suggest that (1) subjective uncertainty is more strongly rooted in information about the candidate than is subjective ambivalence; (2) subjective uncertainty and (to a lesser extent) ambivalence are associated with an increased propensity to engage in memory-based processing; and (3) subjective ambivalence and uncertainty result in more negative evaluations, particularly among less sophisticated people.

Respondents who are located at the middle of the scale tend to have a weak identification with both the nation and the subnation. On the basis of a structural equations modeling approach involving a test of the construct equivalence in the two regions and a control for agreeing-response bias, it is shown that the bipolar national identity variable and attitude toward foreigners are inversely related in Flanders and Wallonia. In Flanders, citizens with a strong subnational identification tend to have a negative attitude toward foreigners; those with a strong Belgian identification are more positive. This relationship became more pronounced after controlling for the respondents' level of education. In Wallonia, a reverse but less pronounced relationship was found. These findings support the hypothesis that the relationship between the variables of national identity and attitude toward foreigners is not intrinsic, but is at least partly determined by the social representation of the nation.","Department of Sociology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium",[]

Nationalist sentiments and traditional patterns of ethnic intolerance were almost immediately revitalized. The analysis presented here concerns nationalist orientation in several of these countries in the context of ideology and social origin, which form links among nationalist identification, ethnic intolerance, democratic and economic orientation, and social class position. In 1996, representative national surveys were carried out in Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics, and Poland. The study was then extended to Austria, where, like in other Western democracies, nationalistic, xenophobic, and rightist-radical attitudes have emerged. Analyses of the attitude structures (structural equation models) showed that different types of nationalism have developed. In post-communist countries-with the exception of the Czech Republic-anticapitalist feelings are strongly correlated with nationalism and ethnic intolerance. Such attitudes are held by the lower classes, yet this form of antiliberalism is not directed against democracy.

Political Psychology 24, no. 1 (2003)","This paper uses newly available evidence to shed light on the circumstances and causes of the 6 October 1973 Yom Kippur surprise attack of Egyptian and Syrian forces on Israeli positions at the Suez Canal and the Golan Heights. The evidence suggests that an important circumstance that accounts for the surprise effect these actions managed to produce, despite ample warning signs, is traceable to a high need for cognitive closure among major figures in the Israeli intelligence establishment. Such a need may have prompted leading intelligence analysts to ""freeze"" on the conventional wisdom that an attack was unlikely and to become impervious to information suggesting that it was imminent. The discussion considers the psychological forces affecting intelligence operations in predicting the initiation of hostile enemy activities, and it describes possible avenues of dealing with the psychological impediments to open-mindedness that may pervasively characterize such circumstances.","Division of International Relations, Department of Political Science","['University of Haifa', 'Department of Psychology', 'University of Maryland, College Park']"

Past research has examined how individual factors such as strength of partisanship or extent of political involvement heighten bias perceptions, but little attention has been paid to interpersonal factors such as the ideological similarity or dissimilarity of personal communication networks. Results of a national survey show that perceptions of media bias were unrelated to the overall amount of discussion but were positively related to conversations with ideologically like-minded individuals. Moreover, the impact of conversations with similar others was stronger among Republicans than among Democrats, a finding consistent with recent work on news self-coverage of media bias claims.",School of Journalism and Communication,"['Ohio State University', 'Science', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison']"

Political Psychology 24, no. 1 (2003)","Political efficacy is a widely studied phenomenon and an important predictor of political participation, but little is known about the political efficacy of the millions of people with disabilities in the United States. This paper reports the results of a nationally representative telephone survey of 1,240 people-stratified to include 700 people with disabilities-following the November 1998 elections. Several measures of efficacy that help predict political activity were found to be significantly lower among people with disabilities than among otherwise similar people without disabilities. Although lower levels of internal efficacy and civic skills could largely be explained by educational and employment gaps, lower levels of other variables (external efficacy, perceived influence of people with disabilities, and perceived treatment of people with disabilities) remained after applying a wide range of controls, indicating that people with disabilities are less likely to see the political system as responsive to them. This perception is concentrated among non-employed people with disabilities. The lower efficacy levels linked to ""disability gaps"" in employment, income, education, and group attendance appear to account for as much as half of the disability political participation gap; hence, policies intended to increase employment and educational opportunities for people with disabilities have potentially important political effects.","School of Management and Labor Relations, Rutgers University","['Department of Political Science, University of Arkansas', 'School of Social Work, University of Arkansas']"

Here, a theoretical model is proposed in which social threat has an impact on authoritarianism specifically, with the effect mediated through social worldview. The model was experimentally tested with a sample of undergraduates who responded to one of three hypothetical scenarios describing a future New Zealand that was secure, threatening, or essentially unaltered. Both threat and security influenced social worldview, but only threat influenced authoritarianism, with differential effects on two factorially distinct subdimensions (conservative and authoritarian social control attitudes) and with the effects of threat mediated through worldview. There was a weak effect of threat on social dominance that was entirely mediated through authoritarianism.

A National Identity Scale was developed and administered to a non-student sample (n = 385) and an undergraduate sample (n = 586) in a metropolitan area of Japan. The results revealed aspects that are common (i.e., etic) to different nationalities and those that are indigenous (i.e., emic) to Japanese people. Factor analyses identified etic factors of patriotism (i.e., love of the homeland), nationalism (belief in superiority over other nations), and internationalism (preference for international cooperation and unity). Attachment to the ingroup and ethnocentrism were thus shown to be separate dimensions. Distinct from these factors, commitment to national heritage emerged as an emic component of Japanese national identity. The discriminant validity of these factors was demonstrated in differential relationships with other variables, such as ideological beliefs and amount of knowledge. Commitment to national heritage was associated with conservatism, whereas internationalism was related to liberal ideology, a high level of media exposure, and knowledge of international affairs. Implications for the study of intergroup and international relations are discussed.","Department of Psychology, Faculty of Letters, Kobe University",[]

A better understanding of the political consequences of 9/11 requires a more complete accounting of the nature and consequences of perceived threat. Here, the distinction between perceived personal and national risks is examined in terms of two competing hypotheses: (1) The personal threat of terrorism has a pervasive influence even on national decisions and perceptions, in line with its highly arousing nature. (2) The effects of personal threat are highly circumscribed and overshadowed by the impact of perceived national threat, consistent with findings on the meager impact of self-interest and other personal concerns on public opinion. A survey of 1,221 residents of Long Island and Queens, New York, explored the degree to which personal and national threat affect perceptions of the consequences of, and possible solutions to, terrorism. As expected, there was a clear distinction between perceived personal and national threat, although the two are related. Perceived personal threat did not influence the perceived economic consequences of terrorism, although it had a narrow effect on personal behaviors designed to minimize risk. Overall, the findings imply that the effects of personal threat are circumscribed, consistent with past research on the limited personal basis of political judgments. However, the tests of these hypotheses were constrained by a limited set of dependent variables that included national consequences but not policy solutions designed to limit terrorism.",Affiliation not found,[]

This study explores such self-serving perceptions of terrorism in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Self-serving judgments on both sides were expected, but their extent is striking, and they extend also to the international incidents. Israeli Arabs judge all acts of violence as terrorism in high percentages. Israeli Jews and Palestinians' definitions present a mirror image; however, they do not project these definitions to the international community. Instead, they perceive an international norm largely divergent from their own point of view, inflating world judgment of their own acts of violence as terrorism and underestimating world judgment of the other side's violence, in what amounts to a hostile-world phenomenon.","Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, Ramallah",[]

It has predictive validity, explaining whites' racial policy preferences considerably better than do traditional racial attitudes or political predispositions. Evidence is presented of its usefulness for both college student and general adult population samples, as well as for minority populations. Data using this scale contradict several critiques of the symbolic racism construct (most of which are speculative rather than based on new data) concerning the consistency of its conceptualization and measurement, the coherence of the symbolic racism belief system, possible artifacts in its influence over whites' racial policy preferences (due to content overlap between the measures of independent and dependent variables), and its differentiation from nonracial conservatism and old-fashioned racism.","University of California, Los Angeles",[]

These differences derive from the political features and social structures of the Arab parties and the Israeli side, which range from hierarchical to networked. Israel leans toward hierarchical order, whereas the Arab parties are more networked; these differences in the social and political environments influence the negotiating culture of each party. Hierarchical states develop goal-oriented negotiating cultures, whereas networked states have process-oriented negotiating cultures. The expectations that each side has of the other side to fulfill its part of the bargain are different as well; in hierarchical states such expectations are based on contracts, whereas in networked states such expectations are based on trust. Because it is unlikely that different cultural perceptions and the gap between the parties can be significantly bridged, it may be possible to cope with mutual problems if all parties were willing to accept a reality of perceptional pluralism (i.e., negotiating asymmetric arrangements, rather then each party insisting on mutual accommodation based on its own perspective).",Department of Political Science,['Tel Aviv University']

An individual with such psychological characteristics may have some advantages in rising to power, and his behavior may be an effective response to some real-life factors, but once he has consolidated his position his reality-testing capacities diminish. Fantasies held in check when his power is limited are apt to become his guides to action. As a consequence, his behavior becomes more erratic, he runs into difficulties in meeting his goals, and his paranoid defenses become more exaggerated.

A survey experiment further showed that negative evaluations of black prisoners are much more strongly tied to support for punitive policies than are negative evaluations of white prisoners. These findings suggest that when many whites think of punitive crime policies to deal with violent offenders, they are thinking of black offenders.","Department of Political Science, University of Kentucky","['Department of Political Science, University of Pittsburgh']"

Political Psychology 23, no. 1 (2002)","Voters develop uniquely simplified perceptions of political candidates' personalities during election campaigns. In an earlier study, voters described their own personalities, and also those of celebrities, using the same five factors typical of the Big Five model of personality. In contrast, the appraisal of political candidates' personalities by voters in both Italy and the United States was reduced to only a few factors. The present research extends that exploration of the relationship between personality and politics to the public's perception of politicians' personalities across a wider variety of politicians and across a long time span after an election campaign. Two studies conducted in Italy, with more than 3,000 voters, replicated the earlier results: The factors of Energy and Agreeableness are primary anchors for evaluating politicians' personalities both during campaigns and for several years thereafter. Also uncovered were congruences between the ways that voters tend to present themselves (self-schemata) and the schemata they use to evaluate candidates representing their political preference.","University of Rome ""La Sapienza""",['Stanford University']

Independent variables included measures of interpersonal trust, valuation of religion, and individualistic versus collective action attributions of responsibility for solving social problems. Interpersonal trust predicted four out of the five outcome variables. Individualistic attribution of social responsibility was a predictor of running for student government office, and collective action attribution was a predictor of conceptualizations of citizenship. Religious valuation also predicted conceptualizations of citizenship as well as feelings of effective community service. For the most part, grade level did not play a significant role in predicting youth's civic orientation.

Drawing on psychological literature, we propose four factors that may have a substantial influence on how much money leaders engaged in ongoing disputes allocate to their military: (1) striving for superiority versus striving for parity in military resources; (2) uncertainty regarding the characteristics of weapons systems; (3) ambiguity regarding the overall capacities of weapons systems; and (4) the tone of messages that adversaries send to one another. The effects of these factors are investigated using a laboratory simulation that combines both experimental and quasi-experimental elements. The results indicate that striving for superiority has a significant effect on defense spending, as does the tone of an opponent's message. By way of contrast, neither uncertainty nor ambiguity exerts a statistically discernable impact on the level of defense spending.",Cornell University,['Stanford University']

Two forms of democratic orientation were investigated in a sample of about 1,000 university students in Japan: a defensive version, which adheres to the formalistic requirements of democracy but is exclusionary and illiberal, and a universalist version that is liberal and tolerant. A defensive orientation is associated with greater chauvinism, a greater sense of threat emanating from foreigners, and a heightened anxiety about economic competition. A universalist orientation is associated with low perceived threat and low chauvinism, a lack of fear of economic competition, and a positive view of the cultural contributions of outsiders. Nativism may indeed be compatible with democratic values, but only with the defensive, exclusionary form. In short, the defensive form is democracy for xenophobes. Such an orientation is not unique to Japan, but is likely to be found in developing democracies as well as in advanced democracies that feel threatened.",University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,['Naruto University of Education']

Undergraduate participants used a computerized system that displayed different layers of information about fictional political candidates; the system recorded the strategies they used to search through this information. Results showed that motivations to engage in effortful processing produced tendencies to engage in within-candidate searches, better recall, and memory structures clustered by candidate. The goal of forming impressions of the candidates, which was expected to lead to within-candidate searching, was in fact modestly associated with weaker tendencies to do so, once effort was taken into account. Impression-formation goals, however, were associated with less attribute-based memory structures. The findings confirm that the manner in which people acquire candidate information has important consequences for the way they store that information in memory, and that these processes vary according to individual motivations and goals.",United Airlines,"['Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania']"

A focus on rivalry, and on the mechanisms that provide for such interaction, may offer a way to bridge existing theories of international relations that rely exclusively on structure or process. Unfortunately, the potential for theory-building has not been fully realized because research into rivalry has tended to be inductive. This paper seeks to rectify that problem by situating the rivalry concept within a social psychological approach to international relations. The rivalry concept is appropriately located in a theoretical approach that views the international system as a social system where actors are conditioned by mechanisms of competition and socialization.","Department of Political Science, Louisiana State University",[]

Two forms of participation, namely active political participation and the more passive psychological involvement of citizens in the democratic process, were treated as separate but related facets of participation. Four competing models were advanced and tested. The data were collected from 434 citizens in the north of Israel who were interviewed by questionnaire. The analysis was performed by structural equations modeling with LISREL VIII. The findings show that the relationship between socioeconomic status and political participation can be better understood as being mediated by personal variables rather than direct. This is demonstrated by the many nonsignificant paths in the direct model. The findings also reveal that active political participation and psychological involvement are distinct but related constructs, where involvement leads to active participation. In addition, all research variables were related more strongly to psychological involvement than to active political participation. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for future research on political participation.","Department of Political Science, University of Haifa",[]

The premise underlying this study is that advisors attempt to frame their policy preferences favorably in order to influence the group process and the president's policy choice. Advisors do so by playing up the positive aspects of an option and downplaying any negative aspects.

Specifically, it uses the ultimatum game as a situation in which the opportunity to deliberate and the placement of this opportunity are experimentally manipulated. Structural factors, such as the players' roles and their ability to vote on the proposal being offered, are also manipulated as a basis for comparison. Two outcomes are examined: the games' allocations, and players' perceptions of fairness. After controlling for structural factors, deliberative opportunity creates a more equitable distribution of money and enhances fairness perceptions. However, these results hold only when such an opportunity occurs before the proposal stage. Deliberative opportunity after the proposal stage has no discernible impact. A survey of participants found that their personal characteristics and political predispositions influence perceptions of fairness for proposers, but not for acceptors. These findings demonstrate the potential benefits of deliberation while highlighting the importance of the nature of its implementation in determining its level of success.","Department of Political Science, University of Washington",[]

The analyses compared the contradictory expectations of the ""racial democracy"" (or ""Iberian exceptionalism"") thesis and social dominance theory. Results showed that despite the very high level of racial intermarriage in the Dominican Republic, there was strong evidence of a ""pigmentocracy,"" or group-based social hierarchy based largely on skin color. Furthermore, despite a slight tendency for people to give slightly higher status ratings to their own ""racial"" category than were given to them by members of other ""racial"" categories, this pigmentocracy was highly consensual across the racial hierarchy. These results were consistent with the expectations of social dominance theory. However, in contrast to similar analyses in the United States and Israel, these Dominican findings showed no evidence that members of different ""racial"" categories had different levels of patriotic attachment to the nation. Also in contrast to recent American findings, there was no evidence that Dominican patriotism was positively associated with anti-black racism, social dominance orientation, negative affect toward other racial groups, or ethnocentrism, regardless of the ""racial"" category one belonged to. These latter results were consistent with the racial democracy thesis. The theoretical implications of these somewhat conflicting findings are discussed.","University of California, Los Angeles",[]

Analyses were then conducted to explore differences in the respondents' likelihood of recommending the most liberal and the most conservative of these policies.

Past research has focused on merit and equality as a basis for support of social welfare programs by examining views of recipients' deservingness; in contrast, this study considers the extent of program support based on recipients' perceived need. Analysis of data from the 1984 National Election Study and from a local survey (Suffolk County, New York, 1989) shows that non-elderly individuals who view older people as financially impoverished are more likely to support government benefits for the aged. Moreover, compassionate support for old-age programs is distinct from liberal ideology; indeed, political conservatives, not liberals, are most likely to support such programs out of compassion for older people, a finding at odds with Sniderman's (Sniderman & Carmines, 1997) notion of principled conservatism. The analysis also revealed that response to elderly need does not convey the effects of long-term and family-based interests; this result substantiates that support of old-age programs can be considered as other-regarding (i.e., reflecting a concern for individuals that is unrelated to one's personal circumstances).

Political Psychology 22, no. 3 (2001)","Starting with a brief review of why all post-industrial societies tend to be inegalitarian, this paper develops two main themes: (1) how the idea that people are individually responsible for their own fates reduces poverty but impedes redistribution, and (2) how both the loose ties of individuals to their societies and the selective nature of their empathy and pity for others reduces compassion for the poor, making redistribution unlikely. The first theme is elaborated through psychological research on dispositional versus circumstantial attributions, showing their effects on the widely shared belief in a just world and more generally on the prevailing theory of the justice of deserts. The attribution-affect-action model is used to show how dispositional attributions evoke either anger or pity for victims and, if anger, then unwillingness to help. The development of the second theme shows how people divorce their own fates from those of their nations, how the basic tendency to favor the familiar and similar limits support for redistribution, how converting concern regarding deprivations of the self to concern for (fraternal) deprivation of people like the self excludes those who most need help, how envy fails to lead to redistribution, and finally, how people's ideas of the privileged and the disadvantaged reflect market values and often mark the poor and the different as overprivileged.","Department of Political Science (emeritus), Yale University",[]

Activists directly affected by regime violence tended to be relatively inexperienced politically, to have little experience with fear, and to see groups as comprising individuals rather than as monolithic wholes.

Regression estimates supported a dissonance reduction explanation of observed attitude changes. Voters, as compared to nonvoters, tended to increase the evaluative distance between candidates after an election, whereas supporters of the losing candidate were more likely than supporters of the winning candidate to decrease such evaluative distances. An additional examination of voters yielded results consistent with dissonance theory: After the election, respondents reporting favorable evaluations of both candidates (a difficult choice) tended to spread comparative candidate evaluations compared to respondents who were favorable toward only one candidate (an easy choice).

For each issue, respondents were randomly assigned to one of three priming conditions that influenced the frame of reference for their policy evaluations. The results show that people are more likely to recognize their own self-interest, and to act upon it, when their stakes in the policy are clear or when they have been primed to think about the personal costs and benefits of the policy. This relationship is somewhat weakened but not eliminated when sociotropic considerations are primed. People with a smaller stake in an issue are less likely to choose on the basis of self-interest and more likely to be influenced by their values and symbolic predispositions, especially when exposed to information that cues sociotropic concerns, group identifications, or value orientations.","Department of Political Science, Northwestern University","['Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley']"

The underlying factors affecting such conflicts are threat perception, ethnic security dilemmas, and lack of trust between nationalist/ethnic groups. The challenge is to find solutions to these conflicts. International institutions can establish trust and reduce the ethnic security dilemma by providing multiple forums of representation, promoting overlapping identities, and pooling sovereignty. Pooling sovereignty across a number of international representative bodies leads to increased access to governmental policymaking, with each party having a stake in government, and leads to a reduction in political tension and conflict. Thus, international parliamentary institutions may provide a solution to these conflicts.

"Bar-Tal, Daniel. ""Why Does Fear Override Hope in Societies Engulfed by Intractable Conflict, as It Does in the Israeli Society?"". Political Psychology 22, no. 3 (2001)","The question of why fear overrides hope in societies embarked on the road of peacemaking after years of intractable conflict is answered on the basis of accumulated knowledge in the psychology and sociology of emotions. This knowledge suggests that fear is an automatic emotion, grounded in the perceived present and often based on the memorized past (also processed unconsciously), that leads to freezing of beliefs, conservatism, and sometimes preemptive aggression. Hope, in contrast, involves mostly cognitive activity, which requires the search for new ideas and thus is based on creativity and flexibility. Because hope is based on thinking, it can be seriously impeded by the spontaneous and unconscious interference of fear. Both fear and hope can become collective emotional orientations that organize society's views and direct its forms of action. It is assumed that societies involved in intractable conflict are dominated by a collective emotional orientation of fear, which is functional in their coping with the stressful and demanding situation. But such an orientation serves as a psychological obstacle to a peace process once it starts. The Israeli Jewish case of collective fear orientation is offered as an example. The presentation includes the roots of this orientation, the ways in which it is reflected and disseminated, and its expressions among the Israeli Jewish public; it ends optimistically with the suggestion that societies can determine to overcome their fear and establish a collective orientation of hope for peace.","School of Education, Tel Aviv University",[]

Despite a strong disagreement concerning the use of these diagnostic labels, there was a surprisingly broad agreement on the actual substance of the discrepant diagnoses. Divisions of opinion, however, arose from political dissension in two areas: the nature of liberal democracies and authoritarian regimes, and the possibility of trust in any political leadership.

"Bar-On, Dan. ""The Silence of Psychologists"". Political Psychology 22, no. 2 (2001)","Unlike certain Israeli historians or sociologists who have developed a critical ""post-Zionist"" approach, Israeli psychologists display few signs of this critical trend. This is especially disquieting in light of the latest back and forth movement between warfare and the peace process-a movement that created many new social and individual dilemmas that would benefit from an open debate within social and clinical psychology. This paper tries to account for this deficiency by looking at its possible historical, political, and cultural roots. The historical aspects relate to the influence of European and American psychological traditions. Two political aspects are presented: (1) Israeli psychologists, through their involvement in the military and their acceptance of the Zionist claim for security, tend to belong to the political mainstream (Gergen, 1973, 1989); and (2) a hyper-political atmosphere scared Israeli psychologists into neutrality and objectivism. This provided a convenient rationale for apoliticism, especially when Israeli political polarization in the 1980s and 1990s was perceived as threatening psychologists' professional authority. Culturally, the psychologists, like the European social strata from which most of them originated, tended to adopt the American tradition of individualism as a reaction to the strong collectivist trend that dominated Israeli society during its early years. This may account for their weak and delayed social response of humanism, feminism, and constructivism. Exceptions to this general trend are highlighted, and the question of how Israeli psychology might become more politically sensitive and critical is explored. This discussion may have relevance for the development of political psychology in other societies, especially those going through transition of values or suffering from long, violent conflicts.","Department of Behavioral Science, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev",[]

However, because these forms enter society in significant ways, reflexive attention must be given to what it is we create.

The discursive approach allows the analyst to look at the continuing dilemmas of an ideology that denies its ideological character.

These accounts, however, were dilemmatic: As the speakers told of social change, they also stressed their own personal stability, as if they themselves existed outside the previous political climate. They also explicitly distanced themselves from the language of ""left"" and ""right,"" but in this distancing a further ideological dilemma was detectable. All the local politicians were officially affiliated to a political party. In discursively subtle ways, the speakers used the left/right continuum as they distinguished between the parties, thereby showing the sort of variability that discursive theorists have noted in other contexts. The implications of such findings and of the discursive approach to studying ideology are discussed in relation to the possibilities for developing a critical political psychology.","Department of Social Sciences, Loughborough University",[]

Hence, the way in which social psychology approaches the matter of self-categorization provides a touchstone for its politics. To the extent that we too take categories for granted, we are in danger of supporting conservative and undemocratic politics. The only way to eschew tendencies toward reification within social psychology is to add a historical dimension to our own analysis of self-categorical processes.","School of Psychology, University of St. Andrews, Scotland","['Department of Psychology, University of Dundee, Scotland']"

Political Psychology 22, no. 1 (2001)","Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, and Sanford's The Authoritarian Personality is probably the most deeply flawed work of prominence in political psychology. The methodological, procedural, and substantive errors of this study are well known, but they are frequently simply attributed to poor methodological judgments, issues of scaling (such as response set), or Freudian theories that legitimated circular interpretations. But a more fundamental bias arose from the attempt to empirically verify the existence of a ""type"" of person whom the researchers thought dangerous and with whom they did not empathize. This attempt involved two dangerous procedures: (1) the fusion of nominalist research procedures (in which empirical results were used to type respondents) with a realist interpretation of types (in which some people ""just were"" authoritarians and others not), and (2) a theoretically rich critique of the authoritarians and a lack of interest in the psychodynamics of liberals. This combination led to an intrinsically biased interpretive project that could not help but accumulate damning evidence about authoritarians. These subtler problems have haunted contemporary work in political psychology that avoids the methodological problems of Adorno et al.; Altemeyer's work on authoritarianism, which not only is free from the defects of the Adorno et al. study but also involves some methodologically exemplary experiments, is similarly distorted by asymmetries. The same fundamental problems seem to be at the heart of the weaknesses of the theory of symbolic racism to which critics have pointed. Political psychologists should regard The Authoritarian Personality as a cautionary example of bias arising from the choice of methodological assumptions.",Department of Sociology,['Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey']

This study tests two competing accounts of how citizens might process such frames. According to the ""passive receiver"" thesis, citizens process elite frames automatically, without engaging in critical thought. In contrast, the ""thoughtful receiver"" thesis holds that the impact of frames may depend on how favorably or unfavorably citizens respond to them. An experiment in value framing produced evidence more consistent with the thoughtful receiver thesis: The message that welfare reform is ""tough love"" influenced opinion only among those it did not anger, whereas the message that welfare reform is ""cruel and inhumane"" produced an effect only among those who judged it to be strong. More generally, these findings suggest that active processing of frames may limit the power of elite framing.",The George Washington University,[]

The second survey elicited positions at that time and also asked voters to recall their prior positions.

Two other hypotheses were tested concerning differences in birth order and sex of siblings between female political leaders and a larger sample of women. A review of the literature on parent-daughter dynamics suggests that this may be another important variable for future research into explanations for the success of women who achieve senior-level positions of power. The findings suggest that first-born women, like first-born men, are overrepresented among political leaders; that first-born women are overrepresented among female political leaders as compared with their numbers in a larger sample population; and that fewer female political leaders have an older brother than would be expected to occur in a larger sample population.

One of the approaches that holds the most promise for political psychologists is social identity theory, as reflected in the thinking of Henri Tajfel, John Turner, and colleagues. Although the theory addresses the kinds of problems of interest to political psychologists, it has had limited impact on political psychology because of social identity theorists' disinclination to examine the sources of social identity in a real world complicated by history and culture. In this review, four key issues are examined that hinder the successful application of social identity theory to political phenomena. These key issues are the existence of identity choice, the subjective meaning of identities, gradations in identity strength, and the considerable stability of many social and political identities.",State University of New York at Stony Brook,[]

Political Psychology 22, no. 1 (2001)","Ethnic identity connects individuals through perceived common past experiences and expectations of shared future ones. Identity is concerned with group judgments and judgments about groups and their motives. This article explores identity through the case of Loyal Order Protestant parades in Northern Ireland and the concepts of psychocultural interpretations (shared, deeply held worldviews found in group narratives) and psychocultural dramas (conflicts over competing, and apparently irresolvable, claims that engage the central elements of a group's historical experience). Psychocultural dramas are polarizing events whose manifest content involves non-negotiable cultural claims, threats, and/or rights that become important because of their connections to core metaphors and group narratives that embody a group's identity. In ethnic conflicts, psychocultural dramas arise over competing claims that evoke deeply rooted dimensions of the conflict which cannot be settled by reference to more general rules or higher authority. Psychocultural dramas are tools of analysis for understanding the centrality of cultural identity and ritual in ethnic conflict and for the redefinition of such conflicts in ways that increase the chances for managing them constructively. Examining the psychocultural dramas surrounding parades disputes in Northern Ireland suggests why and how some conflicts are more amenable to constructive outcomes than others.",Department of Political Science,['Bryn Mawr College']

When news coverage of an election campaign focuses on issues that emphasize rights and morals, voting behavior may be affected in two ways: Citizens become likely to form and make use of evaluations of the integrity of the candidates, and citizens become motivated to seek an issue-position ""match"" with candidates on those issues for which discourse is ethically charged (particularly when they hold a similar interpretation of the issue). These ideas were tested in an experiment in which labor union members and undergraduate students were presented with news stories about the contrasting positions of fictional candidates for elective office. Across three political environments, all information was held constant except for systematic alteration of a different issue in each environment.

Here, a modified version of the story model is applied to statements by military officers in the Soviet Union and in France, representing the situations they face before and after the loss of Eastern Europe and Indochina, respectively (Charlick-Paley, 1997). Both baseline stories and those after the losses of empire are examined to test the hypothesis that when a military experiences the loss of its state's empire, officers will formulate a new story that justifies the change in its status, and that this new story will motivate new patterns of civil-military relations in the post-imperial era. The hypothesis finds general support, and stories are found to be a useful vehicle in understanding differences between groups of military officers. An analysis of how officers' stories change over time yields intriguing results as to how mutable stories are and which elements of a story are most likely to change first.

Political Psychology 21, no. 4 (2000)","This study reevaluates the persuasive impact of emotional visual appeals within politics and examines two different explanations for their effects. One possibility is that the effects of emotive visual images are essentially superficial in nature, consistent with the view that feelings aroused by an affective image are transferred somewhat mechanically to a political candidate or cause with which it is paired. This transfer-of-affect explanation suggests that emotional appeals may work best among the least informed voters or those paying the least attention to a persuasive political message. The second possibility is that emotional appeals work via passionate reason, in which affective responses to an emotive image are integrated with, and potentially bias, reasoned thought about the accompanying message. This integrated approach leads to the counterintuitive prediction that individuals who are most highly involved in an issue (and who know the most about it) are most influenced by emotional imagery. This prediction arises from growing evidence that people highly involved in value-laden social issues generate the strongest emotional responses to issue-related persuasive appeals. These two models were tested in a study in which undergraduate students were presented with a picture of a cute or an ugly animal and a flyer from an organization advocating a pro- or anti-environment stance with respect to preserving the animal's habitat. The responses showed that emotive imagery was most persuasive among the most involved environment supporters, providing clear evidence of passionate reasoning.",State University of New York at Stony Brook,['University of Arizona']

Political alienation can be expressed as comprising two dimensions, political trust and civic-mindedness. Males and people with more years of schooling are more allegiant in general; that is, they are both more trusting and more civic-minded. Evaluations of cabinet performance and support for democratic mechanisms are strongly related to political trust and civic-mindedness. Supporters of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are no more civic-minded than average but are more trusting politically, whereas Japan Communist Party supporters are more civic-minded but a good deal less politically trusting than average. Independents are below the overall average on both the political trust and civic-mindedness dimensions. Even though party support is unstable, Japan's political system will not lose its stability as long as LDP supporters and independents constitute the majority of Japan's electorate.

Less is known about the etiology of individual-targeted tolerance, or the question of whether Americans are willing to tolerate the exercise of constitutional rights and freedoms by individuals who belong to unpopular groups. This paper examines the sources of attitudes toward individuals belonging to disliked and stereotyped political groups-in particular, the extent to which political tolerance judgments about gay and racist targets are influenced by attributes of those targets that are either consistent or inconsistent with group stereotypes. In line with expectations, an empirical analysis showed that individuals exhibiting attributes inconsistent with their group's stereotype (whether neutral with respect to stereotypic beliefs or directly challenging them) are tolerated more than those with stereotype-consistent attributes. Because members of political outgroups can control the timing of disclosing their group membership, they have the power to determine whether and to what extent stereotypic beliefs associated with their group will influence the reactions they provoke. This analysis confirms that the impact of stereotypic beliefs on tolerance varies as a function of timing of group membership revelation, although the direction of this interaction depends on the intensity of dislike for the group of which the individual target is a member.",Department of Political Science,['Tufts University']

Contrary to the notion that normative (rational) decision-making is more likely in less dramatic settings, the results indicate that elevated threat encourages rational decision processing, whereas heuristic processing was more prevalent in less threatening situations. Interestingly, the added presence of high stakes magnified both threat effects. These results, although preliminary, suggest that stakes-threat effects are not direct reflections of stress and/or complexity effects, but should be considered independently in foreign policy analyses.",Department of Political Science,['Texas A&M University']

Critics of deliberative democracy believe that this hope is unrealistic-that deliberation either will prove intractable across political differences or will exacerbate instability. This paper deploys some tools of political psychology, notably Q methodology and values analysis, to investigate the conditions under which effective deliberation is likely to occur. These tools are applied to contemporary political debates in Australia, concerned with how the Australian polity should be constituted in light of a reform agenda underpinned by a discourse we term ""Inclusive Republicanism."" An investigation of the character of the basic value commitments associated with discursive positions in these debates shows that some differences will yield to deliberation, but others will not. When two discourses subscribe to different value bases, deliberation will induce reflection and facilitate positive-sum outcomes. When a discourse has a value base but finds its specific goals opposed by a competitor that otherwise has no value base of its own, deliberation will be ineffective. When one discourse subscribes to a value base that another questions, but without providing an alternative, deliberation can help to bridge idealism and cynicism.",Department of Political Science,"['University of Melbourne', 'Research School of Social Sciences', 'Australian National University']"

In particular, the desire to appear politically correct, and to avoid being seen as racist, sexist, or culturally insensitive, can lead people to espouse publicly support for politically correct issues, such as support for affirmative action, despite privately held doubts. Such discrepancies between public behavior and private attitudes, when accompanied by divergent attributions for one's own behavior and the identical behavior of others, can lead to pluralistic ignorance. Two studies investigated pluralistic ignorance with respect to affirmative action among undergraduates. Their survey responses indicate that people overestimate their peers' support for affirmative action and underestimate their peers' opposition to affirmative action, that people's ratings of the political correctness of supporting affirmative action are correlated with their overestimation of support for affirmative action, and that people view their own attitudes toward affirmative action as unique.","Department of Psychology,",['Cornell University']

Respondents belonging to cohorts born in 1971, 1972, and 1973 were surveyed in 1987, 1988, and 1994. The questionnaires measured variables relevant to the social-cognitive action theory model of personality: self-concept of political competence, beliefs about political locus of control, political knowledge, trust in politics, satisfaction with politics, and political activity in everyday life. The results are interpreted with respect to the correlative and absolute stability versus plasticity of the variables from 1987 to 1994, as well as the predictive value of the action theory personality variables for political activities and for voting behavior measured 7 years later. Longitudinal results indicate a high predictive value of self-concept of political competence and political knowledge for political activity and voting in early adulthood. Because only these two personality variables showed relatively high positional stability coefficients from adolescence to early adulthood, the discussion refers to the necessity of early developmental interventions to prevent extreme types of politically uninterested and passive adults. Therefore, the social-cognitive action theory personality model of political participation is extended to a social-cognitive action theory personality model of political socialization in the life span.",Affiliation not found,[]

The respondents' reactions to the two events were compared as a function of gender and political orientation. About 50% of the respondents who changed their political views immediately after the assassination reverted to pre-event attitudes 5 months later. Emotional reactions to the assassination showed substantial fading after 5 months, with extent of fading unaffected by gender or political orientation. The intensity of emotional reactions was affected by political orientation: Although Rabin's supporters and his opponents reacted with equal intensity to the terror attacks, supporters reacted with the same intensity to Rabin's assassination, whereas opponents' reactions to the assassination were less intense.",Department of Psychology,"['Tel Aviv University', 'Department of Statistics and Operations Research', 'Ora Silberstein and Orna Diver']"

Political Psychology 21, no. 2 (2000)","This study explored the associations among income level, economic beliefs, and political party preference in terms of self-interest and ideological theories of party preference. Results from a survey of 487 New Zealand voters showed that the income levels and economic beliefs of supporters of the four major parties were organized along a single dimension: ACT supporters had the highest income and strongest neoliberal economic beliefs, followed closely by National supporters, whereas Alliance supporters had the lowest income and strongest welfare-state economic beliefs, followed by Labour supporters. However, the prediction of party preference from income and economic beliefs showed a different pattern: Income significantly predicted support for ACT, National, and Alliance; economic beliefs had the strongest influence on National and Labour support; and economic beliefs interacted with income to influence ACT and National support, but not Labour and Alliance support. The results suggest that voters who have gained or lost the most from the implementation of neoliberal policies-in this case, those with the highest and lowest incomes (i.e., ACT and Alliance supporters), respectively-form political party preference mainly from economic self-interest, whereas middle-income voters (i.e., National and Labour supporters) form party preference from ideological congruence.

Political Psychology 21, no. 2 (2000)","Intractable intergroup conflicts require the formation of a conflictive ethos that enables a society to adapt to the conflict situation, survive the stressful period, and struggle successfully with the adversary. The formal termination of such a conflict begins with the elimination of the perceived incompatibility between the opposing parties through negotiation by their representatives-that is, a conflict resolution process. But this is only part of the long-term reconciliation process, which requires the formation of peaceful relations based on mutual trust and acceptance, cooperation, and consideration of mutual needs. The psychological aspect of reconciliation requires a change in the conflictive ethos, especially with respect to societal beliefs about group goals, about the adversary group, about the ingroup, about intergroup relations, and about the nature of peace. In essence, psychological reconciliation requires the formation of an ethos of peace, but this is extremely difficult in cases of intractable conflict.

The three measures correlated substantially, thus validating the naming and latency measures as reasonable approximations of the likelihood that a given item will receive activation in memory when the category is presented.

Finally, attitudes associated with univalent and extreme underlying structures should occasion relatively little decision conflict and thus should be highly accessible.

Some findings indicated that selective processing mediated the relationship between attitude involvement and attitude extremity and ambivalence.

Although many scholars have presumed that these so-called response effects are likely to be more pronounced when the attitudes being measured are weak, a number of studies have disconfirmed this notion. This paper presents several new tests of this hypothesis using a variety of measures and analytic techniques. The findings largely replicated previously documented effects and non-effects but also uncovered new effects not previously tested. No single strength-related attitude attribute emerged as a consistent moderator of all response effects. Rather, different individual attributes moderated different effects, and a conglomeration of strength-related dimensions did not emerge as a reliable moderator. Taken together, these results support the conclusions that different response effects occur as the result of different cognitive processes, and that various strength-related attitude attributes reflect distinct latent constructs rather than a single one.",University of Toronto at Scarborough,['Ohio State University']

The process of building leadership image rests on prior expectations about the leader, policy outputs, the course of events, and the disposition of political resources. In building images of leadership, each of the three constituencies puts more weight on some aspects of image-building than on others: The public sees the president primarily in terms of his previous behavior, the media view the president through the lens of immediate events, and other elected officials focus on political resources. One of the president's most important resources is his public image. It can help him to maintain the loyalty of other officials, which in turn contributes to balanced news coverage, even in times of crisis. President Clinton was able to preserve his public image through the impeachment debacle in large part because of low public expectations about his personal moral behavior and satisfaction with his economic leadership.

It draws on work in anthropology and foreign policy analysis. The first step is to view culture as a ""toolkit of environmental ideas."" The second step, relative to a given research topic, is to delimit broad definitions of culture to more workable forms. Three forms are offered (following Hudson, 1997a): culture as organization of environmental meaning, as shared value preferences in environmental matters, and as templates for environmental action. The third step is to answer three basic questions relative to the specific definition of culture used: (a) Who draws what environmentally related ideas from the ideas toolkit? (b) How are these ideas used in the political arena? (c) How do these ideas, originally drawn upon for political purposes, change and in turn lead to changes in the set of environmentally related ideas in the culture? Ideas, once they have entered the political arena, are assumed to be embodied in a ""discourse."" The terminology of discourse (and the body of theory built up around it) is used as a vehicle for examining the role of culture in international environmental policymaking.

Political Psychology 20, no. 4 (1999)","A core characteristic of world politics is the presence of communal conflict over ideas of national identity, inextricably bound to ideas of cultural identity. Increasingly, foreign policy decision-makers realize the importance of considering cultural factors in their calculations of how peoples will define the ""self"" that seeks ""determination."" Although a collective's culture changes over time (through interaction with others and in response to external events), scholars and policy analysts sometimes treat identities as static, monolithic, and derived from cultures that rarely change. This leads policymakers to underestimate the extent to which culture influences and can be influenced by foreign policy. This paper integrates work in political science and psychology into a content analysis-based method for examining three major ways in which culture impinges on communal conflict. The utility of the approach is demonstrated with a case study of the Northern Ireland conflict from 1984 to 1986, which shows how the rhetoric of the competing nationalist/Catholic leaders (John Hume and Gerry Adams) was the site of debate over group culture, how differences in the rhetoric reflected different cultures of the conflict, and how the conflict has been affected by the foreign policy decisions of other actors.",Department of Political Science,"['Ohio State University and University of Vermont', 'St. Bonaventure University']"

According to this variant of culture theory, decision-makers faced with new situations will rely on established behavioral competencies in forming an initial policy response. This assumption can also be applied at the nation-state level, where established behavioral predispositions may lessen uncertainty and stress in ambiguous yet salient foreign policy situations. Likewise, observers in one nation-state may be able to identify such behavioral dispositions in other nation-states, lending greater transparency and predictability to international interactions. Do such culturally based action templates exist? Are they recognizable even to ordinary citizens? Citizens in Russia, Japan, and the United States were asked to posit the most likely and least likely behavioral responses to a variety of foreign policy situations by their own nation and by the other two nations in the sample. The results indicate that recognition of such templates takes place, and that recognition of one nation's template content by citizens of the other nations typically matches recognition of template content by the nation's own citizens.

Results from the first study show that identity does affect conflict behavior, but only as it is mediated be levels of insecurity. Increased feelings of security correspond to more cooperative behavior. Positive and negative images of the opponent, on the other hand, did not influence conflict behavior.

The second part uses survey data from German youth and young adults (n = 7,280, ages 13 to 30) to describe typical age patterns for various types of unconventional behavior. The more unconventional the behavior, the more the curve resembles what criminologists have long found for deviant behavior. Youth approval of the more disruptive forms of political behavior has a left-skewed age distribution that is also typical of deviant behavior. This suggests an unappealing combination of potential actionism and political ignorance occurring in late adolescence, a possibility that ought to be of consequence for the design of civic education and other interventions. From a research perspective, these age-typical patterns can be useful as a theory-building and theory-testing strategy by treating them as baselines against which individual and cultural variations can be measured.",Department of Political Science,['University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee']

Despite its theoretical dominance, the details of this perceptual pathway of parental socialization have rarely been examined empirically. A major Swedish socialization study offers unusually good opportunities to investigate how it actually operates. The results indicate that the perceptual pathway as a whole is of great but not universal significance, that perception is more important than persuasion because of its greater variability, and that the conditions regulating the former are distinct from those regulating the latter. One implication of the results is that studies of interpersonal influence based on a single source (e.g., the child alone) are likely to yield a very lopsided view of the socialization process.",Department of Government,"['Uppsala University, Sweden']"

A sample of 197 Jewish/Israeli university students responded to a questionnaire that included items on attitudes toward the Middle East peace process as well as a personality measure. The results confirmed the hypothesis: Individuals who were less supportive of the peace process were more authoritarian conformists than were supporters of the process. A significant association between religiosity and attitudes toward the peace process was also found; the split between peace supporters and non-supporters corresponded roughly, though not exactly, to the split between religious and non-religious. The pro-peace individual is generally non-religious, less authoritarian conformist, and less aggressive. Hence, the social cognitions studied-beliefs about the peace process-may be group beliefs. Certain characteristics of the groups in question, such as socialization practices and social structure, may account for the personality features that covaried with the beliefs.

Each familiar face was made more neotenous by enlarging eyes and lips, and made more mature by reducing the sizes of these features. Undergraduate perceivers rated one version of each face. Though unaware offeature changes, perceivers were affected by them. In Study I, neotenous features made Clinton seem more honest and attractive, even to perceivers who did not support him in the 1996 election. In Study 2, mature features made Kennedy, the youngest U.S. president, seem more cunning and made Reagan, the oldest president, appear less powerful and less warm; neotenous features reduced ratings of both Kennedy's and Reagan's power, whereas neotenizing the familiar face of Clinton increased ratings of his honesty and attractiveness without diminishing perceptions of his power.

"Gamson, William A., Hanna Herzog. ""Living with Contradictions: The Taken-for-Granted in Israeli Political Discourse"". Political Psychology 20, no. 2 (1999)","Two apparently contradictory ideas are closely linked in Israeli political discourse: Israel is powerful and independent and Israel is vulnerable and dependent. This study used content analysis and focus groups, as well as existing survey data analyzed by others, to explore how this paradox has been reflected in newspapers and conversations during six different time periods from 1948 to 1996. The goal was not to explain the paradox but to examine its consequences for Israeli perceptions of U.S. policy in the Middle East-and, in the process, to explore Israeli self-images. The nature of U.S. strategic interests was originally treated as problematic and in need of political discussion, but in the past 25 years these interests have become taken for granted. Surprisingly, even after the end of the Cold War, a critical discourse moment in which a reexamination of U.S. interests in the Middle East would seem inevitable, the U.S. role remains taken for granted and largely unexamined. The strong/vulnerable paradox explains this absence of discussion: Examining U.S. interests too closely upsets the delicate balance that keeps the sense of vulnerability in check.",Sociology Department,"['Boston College', 'Tel Aviv University']"
"Hemmer, Christopher. ""Historical Analogies and the Definition of Interests: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and Ronald Reagan's Policy toward the Hostages in Lebanon"". Political Psychology 20, no. 2 (1999)","Students of political psychology have long shown an interest in exploring how analogical reasoning affects decision-making. However, the existing literature on analogical reasoning has remained within the rationalist explanatory framework by assuming that an actor's interests can be deduced from that actor's position in a certain material structure, thus treating those interests as unaffected by the process of analogical reasoning. This assumption unduly restricts the role that analogies may play. Analogies can do more than simply allow decision-makers to figure out what specific policies will advance their preexisting interests-they can also determine the interests themselves. To demonstrate the benefits of moving the analogical literature beyond rationalism, this article explores the Reagan administration's policy toward American hostages in Lebanon, which culminated in the Iran-Contra scandal.","Cornell-in-Washington Program, Cornell University",[]

Political Psychology 20, no. 2 (1999)","Research on gender differences in political alignments and cultural orientations in the past decades reveals a large value change in women relative to that in men, indicating that women might recently have become less conservative than men, whereas women used to be more conservative in many respects. In this article this possible reversal in the gender gap in recent decades is analyzed. Recent research has demonstrated that in the Netherlands women are presently less conservative than men. This lower level of conservatism in Dutch women is apparent with respect to both economic and cultural issues. It is investigated whether these gender differences are due to a reversal in the gender gap in the Netherlands and if so, how this emerging gender gap can be explained. Three explanations are hypothesized: one in terms of the characteristics of the youngest generations (the gender-cohort model), the second in terms of growing structural equality between women and men in general (the situational/structural model), and a specification of the second model, in which differential effects of structural factors for women and men are presumed to have their effect (the gender-interaction model). Neither of the three tested models was in itself able to fully explain the results. The gender gap can partly be explained by growing structural equality between women and men, partly by the fact that the gender gap is largest in the youngest generations (economic conservatism), and partly by the fact that the gender gap is largest between groups of ""independent"" women and their male counterparts. Possible additional determinants are also discussed.","Department of Youth, Family and Life Course","['Utrecht University, Netherlands']"

Political Psychology 20, no. 1 (1999)","Previous research in social dominance theory has found an asymmetry in the relationship between social dominance orientation (SDO) and various hierarchy-enhancing ideologies, such that the relationship between the two variables is significantly more positive among high-status group members than among low-status group members (Sidanius, Pratto, & Rabinowitz, 1994; Sidanius, Levin, & Pratto, 1996). Perceptions of systemic injustice toward one's ingroup may help to explain this ideological asymmetry. The hypothesis of a three-way interaction among group status, SDO, and perceived injustice was tested by using survey responses from American university students to predict opposition to hierarchy-attenuating policies as well as levels of patriotism. Analyses revealed the presence of a three-way interaction (ps < .05).

Here, data derived from a Q-methodological study of Basque national identity are used to show that claims advanced within the existing literature appear to be restricted in their ability to explain subjective attachment to the nation; that is, they cannot adequately account for the types of bonds that emerged from the Basque case study. Primarily through Q methodology, an alternative explanation and method for uncovering the ties between individuals and groups is offered.

Political Psychology 20, no. 1 (1999)","Bureaucratic politics-for example, the ""political"" interaction between individuals and organizations in the executive branch of government-is a potentially significant force affecting the course and outcomes of governmental policymaking processes. In this article, an empirical and normative model and operationalization of bureaucratic politics is developed, treating it as a variable rather than as an immutable (and by definition problematic) property of policy decision-making. A conceptual model, linking the nature and intensity of bureaucratic politics in advisory systems to the characteristics of the political leaders served by them, is also developed. On the basis of earlier studies of presidential leadership (e.g., Preston, 1996), the leader's need for power, cognitive complexity, and prior policy experience/expertise are hypothesized to affect the organization and operation of the advisory system in terms of bureaucratic politics. Using Hermann's (1983) Personality Assessment-at-a-Distance (PAD) coding technique, theoretical assertions are illustrated in a detailed case study of two critical episodes in U.S. decision-making in the conduct of the Vietnam war in 1965 and 1968.","Department of Political Science, Washington State University","[""Paul't Hart"", 'Department of Public Administration, Leiden University']"

Theoretical predictions of social identity theory and social dominance theory were tested. Results indicated that for all high- and low-status groups, stronger ingroup identification was associated with more positive ingroup affect, and for nearly all groups, higher SDO was associated with more negative affect toward the low-status group. In addition, SDO was positively associated with ingroup identification for all high-status groups, and negatively associated with ingroup identification for almost all low-status groups.

Blind patriotism is defined as an attachment to country characterized by unquestioning positive evaluation, staunch allegiance, and intolerance of criticism. Constructive patriotism is defined as an attachment to country characterized by support for questioning and criticism of current group practices that are intended to result in positive change. Items designed to investigate these dimensions of national attachment were administered to two groups of undergraduates in separate surveys. Measures of the two constructs derived from factor analysis of the responses proved to be reliable and valid. Blind patriotism was positively associated with political disengagement, nationalism, perceptions of foreign threat, perceived importance of symbolic behaviors, and selective exposure to pro-U.S. information. In contrast, constructive patriotism was positively associated with multiple indicators of political involvement, including political efficacy, interest, knowledge, and behavior.

Political Psychology 20, no. 1 (1999)","This paper explores relationships between basic personality profiles of voters and their political party preferences. The Italian political system has moved recently from previously extreme, ideologically distinctive parties to form complex coalitions varying around more centrist orientations. Significant evidence was found for the utility of the Five-Factor Model of Personality in distinguishing between voters' expressed preferences, even given this greater subtlety in proposed values and agendas. More than 2,000 Italian voters who self-identified as having voted for new center-left or center-right political coalitions differed systematically in predicted directions on several personality dimensions measured by the Big Five Questionnaire. In the context of the model, center-right voters displayed more Energy and slightly more Conscientiousness than center-left voters, whose dominant personality characteristics were Agreeableness (Friendliness) and Openness; Emotional Stability was unrelated to either group. This relationship between individual differences in personality and political preferences was not influenced by the demographic variables of voters' gender, age, or education. Thus, personality dimensions proved to be stronger predictors of political preference than any of these standard predictor variables. Implications are discussed regarding links among personality, persuasion, power, and politics.","University of Rome ""La Sapienza""",['Stanford University']

Three main trends were found in the results. First, both leaders' conception of their political environment changed over time, from basically conflictual in the 1970s to essentially neutral in the 1990s. Second, the remainder of Rabin's operational code, including a surprisingly strong predisposition to approach politics in a cooperative manner, was generally constant across time. Third, unlike Rabin, several other components of Peres's operational code underwent acute fluctuations, seemingly in response to the perceived different situational context. On the basis of these results and the operational code construct in general, a typology was created that classifies leaders according to their predisposition to pursue either cooperative or conflictual strategies and their level of responsiveness to their political environment.",Department of Political Science,['Louisiana State University']

A sample of 131 college students completed questionnaires that measured authoritarianism, degree of economic and societal insecurity, and attitudes toward eight political issues. Economic and social insecurity were indexed to perceptions of whether one's standard of living had declined, whether income inequality had grown among social classes, and whether crime, race relations, environmental quality, and governmental services had worsened. The political scales reflected issues currently debated in public forums; they included funding mechanisms for social security and health care, the state's role in regulating abortion, government services for illegal immigrants, terminating welfare for unemployed women with children, and regulation of sexual conduct. A logistic model found that, relative to non-threatened authoritarians or nonauthoritarians, threatened authoritarians were six times as likely to favor restricting benefits to powerless groups and eight times as likely to support the state's preventing women from securing an abortion.

When measures of optimism were used as determinants of trust in the estimation of a simultaneous equation model, the effects of television vanished.

In two of these conditions, they wrote essays designed to create either a positive or negative mood; in the other two conditions, they read essays designed to highlight either the costs or benefits of friendship. Results indicated that individuals low in trust were susceptible to situational influences. Low-trust individuals chose more real social activities when in a positive mood or when benefits of friendship were salient, whereas they chose ersatz social activities when in a bad mood or when costs of friendship were salient. High-trust individuals showed relatively high preference for real social interactions regardless of mood or the salience of costs and benefits.

Such changes could not be accounted for by the explanations for declining trust offered in other accounts of social capital. An alternative explanation, based on the theoretical accounts of Alexis de Tocqueville and Emile Durkheim, is that materialistic values may be undermining young people's views about the trustworthiness of others. Both aggregate time series correlations and an individual-level model show that the rapid rise of materialistic value orientations that occurred among American youth in the 1970s and 1980s severely eroded levels of social trust.

The production of social capital in personal networks was examined with the use of social network and participation data from the 1992 American study of the Cross National Election Project. The results suggest that politically relevant social capital (that is, social capital that facilitates political engagement) is generated in personal networks, that it is a by-product of the social interactions with a citizen's discussants, and that increasing levels of politically relevant social capital enhance the likelihood that a citizen will be engaged in politics. Further, the production of politically relevant social capital is a function of the political expertise within an individual's network of relations, the frequency of political interaction within the network, and the size or extensiveness of the network. These results are sustained even while taking account of a person's individual characteristics and organizational involvement. Hence, the consequences of social relations within networks are not readily explained away on the basis of either human capital effects or the effects of organizational engagement.",Indiana University,[]

This study builds on previous work emphasizing the political relevance of civic norms prescribing social cooperation.

The analysis shows that a person's likelihood of voting increases with the census response rate in the county of residence, controlling for the usual set of factors associated with turnout. The probability of voting was also correlated with the incidence of cooperative behavior in other arenas, such as giving to charities or willingly serving on juries. These findings provide support for the importance of cooperative norms in explaining political participation. In addition, the relationship between voting and county-level census response was significantly greater among respondents who read newspapers more often; hence, newspapers evidently are one means by which social expectations are communicated.","School of Public Affairs, American University","['Survey Research Center, University of Maryland']"

Three specific questions were explored: (1) whether civic engagement in a post-communist state differs from that in an established Western democracy; (2) whether the quality of social perception suffers when civic engagement is constrained; and (3) whether a link exists between civic engagement and tangible forms of political judgment. Data were analyzed from surveys conducted in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 1994 and in South Bend, Indiana, in 1984. Compared with South Bend residents, the people of Cluj-Napoca discuss politics less, engage in interactive forms of political participation at lower rates, know less about their neighbors, and fail to link the interests of people in the community to broader political judgments. Given the centrality of civic engagement to democratic legitimacy, these findings justify concern regarding the prospects for full democratization in Central and Eastern European contexts in which social interaction does not yet flourish.",Department of Political Science,"['Florida State University', 'Department of History and Social Science', 'Buffalo State College']"

Political Psychology 19, no. 2 (1998)","The assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a political assassin caused shock, disbelief, and deep grief to the Israeli people. Particularly prominent was the reaction of the youth, who gathered in large crowds, at the site of the murder and in other places, and engaged in various mourning behaviors of a ritual nature. This drew the attention of the media in Israel and around the world. A study of approximately 700 teenagers conducted after the assassination examined their emotional reactions, participation in ritualistic mourning activities, and assessments of the reasons for feeling shocked. In all areas, differences were found as a function of gender, and attitudes toward Rabin's peace policy.

Political Psychology 19, no. 2 (1998)","Established models of the domestic policymaking process accord some role to the individual decision-maker, but they usually fail to show how policy decisions are ultimately influenced by the character of the information available to the policymakers concerned. Drawing on one prominent model of decision-making developed by analysts of foreign policy-the analogical reasoning approach-this article proposes that individual-level approaches are most useful in domestic policy analysis where decision-makers must confront a discrete policy ""episode"" in which perceived levels of cognitive uncertainty and ambiguity are high. An analysis of decision-making by political leaders during the 1967 Detroit riots reveals that these leaders made widespread use of historical analogies at various stages of the policymaking process. Policymakers can probably be expected to rely on analogizing under circumstances and contexts that make cognitive demands similar to those observed in the Detroit case.","Department of Government, University of Essex, England",[]

This paper reviews cognitive, cultural, and systemic reasons for this bias. The efficacy of education as a way to increase structural thinking was investigated in two studies of college students' causal thinking about group inequalities. Both studies involved a course on intergroup relations that covered structural sources of racial or ethnic inequalities. Results supported hypotheses that the course would increase structural thinking about racial or ethnic inequality, and that structural thinking would generalize to inequalities not explicitly covered in the course. Both course content and active learning pedagogy were related to structural thinking about inequalities. Active learning was also related to applying structural thinking to targets of change.","Department of Psychology, Syracuse University","['Department of Psychology, University of Michigan', 'School of Social Work, University of Washington']"

Political Psychology 19, no. 2 (1998)","This paper is an experiment in understanding the logic of communism from the perspective of political psychology. In Hungary, communism became a means for transforming the entire psychical make-up of a country in a moment of reduced intensity of consciousness, a transitory or liminal period, produced by the Second World War. In liminal conditions, unconscious impulses are set free that are channeled by the use of archetypical images. As an empirical case study, this paper discusses the speeches of the first post-war Hungarian Communist Party leader, Mátyás Rákosi, delivered in the years immediately after the devastations of the war, in an effort to discern the techniques and mechanisms by which the Communist Party managed to capture the allegiance of a large segment of the population. The analysis of these speeches and their effects indicates that communism was not merely a consequence of Soviet occupation, and therefore the withdrawal of the troops did not eliminate the lasting, mostly hidden but still predominant, effects of communism on the countries that were in its grip.",European University,"['European University Institute', 'European University']"

Political Psychology 19, no. 2 (1998)","This paper examines the ideological asymmetry hypothesis with respect to the interface between legitimizing ideologies and psychological attachment to one's ethnic group. The ideological asymmetry hypothesis suggests that hierarchy-enhancing legitimizing ideologies should be positively associated with ingroup attachment among high-status groups, but that among low-status groups these associations should be either less positive in magnitude (isotropic asymmetry) relative to high-status groups or negative in direction (anisotropic asymmetry). The opposite pattern should be found with respect to the interface between hierarchy-attenuating legitimizing ideologies and ingroup attachment: Among high-status groups these associations should be negative, but among low-status groups these associations should be either less negative in magnitude (isotropic asymmetry) relative to high-status groups or positive in direction (anisotropic asymmetry). The presence of isotropic versus anisotropic asymmetry is hypothesized to depend on the degree of disparity in status between the groups being compared: Wider status gaps should tend toward anisotropic asymmetries. The relationships between legitimizing ideologies and ingroup attachment were compared for (1) relatively high-status ethnic groups (European and Asian Americans) versus relatively low-status ethnic groups (Latinos and African Americans) in the United States, (2) the higher-status Jewish ethnic group (Ashkenazim) versus the lower-status Jewish ethnic group (Mizrachim) in Israel, and (3) the high-status Israeli Jews versus the low-status Israeli Arabs. The data were largely consistent with the ideological asymmetry hypothesis. The implications of these findings are discussed within the theoretical frameworks of social dominance theory and other approaches to intergroup relations.","University of California, Los Angeles",[]

Eight parties that ran in the 1988 Israeli elections were arrayed by judges on three ideological dimensions: classical liberalism, economic egalitarianism, state and religion. Discriminant analyses yielded a function whose coefficients for value types corresponded to hypotheses for the state and religion dimension and ordered party supporters on this dimension. After dropping religious parties, another value-based function ordered party supporters on the classical liberalism dimension, as predicted. Both functions significantly improved the party classification of voters in a representative national sample (N=769). Economic egalitarianism, a nonsalient dimension in Israeli politics, was unrelated to values.

The empirical data show that there is a great deal of variation in perceptions of problems and ways of accomplishing change.

Both feminists and Islamists contested traditional political values by insisting on their own definition of their interests, as opposed to those that were state-enforced. The feminists questioned the justice of formal equality as they sought substantive equality; Islamist women challenged the secular concept of equality as they insisted on the justice of male-female complementarity. Both groups engaged in active politics and expanded the parameters of democratic participation as they sought substantive equality beyond formal equality.

Public attention has been diverted by concern over such relatively marginal issues as the headscarf affair, and insufficient attention has been paid to the important role Muslim women play in France, especially those coming from Algeria. These women function as cultural mediators between the traditional culture of the sending country and the modern one of the host country. They see themselves as both tradition-bearers and integration proponents. The demands of immigration have given rise to the growth and development of different leaders, among them cultural mediators seeking a bridge between Islam and modernity, economic mediators seeking to establish women in the media and as entrepreneurs, and political mediators who seek access to power at the local level for the immigrants. These new mediators will eventually shape a new generation of female actors very far from the traditional countries of origin, although for the time being they still suffer from the inequality of rights for women and chances in their overall social life.",Centre d'Etudes et de Recherches Internationales,[]

An analysis of data from the 1996 Japanese Elections and Democracy Study survey and from 18 focus groups conducted in 1996 indicates that women in Japan are not moralists. As elsewhere, there is a gender gap in Japan on ""issue preference sets,"" with women favoring a ""care"" agenda, but women assign political ethics less importance than do men, even though women are more likely to see adverse effects from political corruption. Studying people's judgments of four ethics scenarios reveals minimal gender gaps; controlling for education and age, women's judgments overall are less, not more, strict than men's. Among women, age is a better predictor of moralism than education; older women are stricter than younger women on political ethics. This is attributed to gender-based differences in moral reasoning: Japanese women and men both rely heavily on a ""relation-based"" frame (which is situation-specific and requires extensive social information), but gender stratification patterns create information inequalities. Younger women lack social information necessary for judging political misconduct, whereas older women overcome the information deficit through life experience.",Harvard University,[]

Dependent variables include attitudes and behaviors, the latter in the form of policy preferences arranged on a cooperative-conflictual continuum. The results indicate that images do matter. When the perceived relationship is hostile, subjects develop more negative attitudes toward their opponents and choose more conflictual policies. Cultural differences produce more negative attitudes in all conditions but result in more negative policy selections only when the perceived relationship is hostile. In other words, in considering policy moves, cultural differences exacerbate conflict between enemies, but make no difference between friends, in spite of the negative outgroup attitudes they elicit.",Department of Political Science,['Louisiana State University']

While there are numerous empirical studies and theoretical frameworks on the leadership styles of U.S. presidents, few studies of prime ministers are concerned with personality and styles of leadership. This paper reviews the literature on U.S. presidential styles and on organizational leadership in order to construct a framework for the study of prime minister leadership styles. Components of the proposed framework are illustrated with examples of British prime ministers and German chancellors. In addition, categories of dependent variables to be explained by leadership style are discussed.

The most extensive of these studies has been conducted by Holsti and Rosenau who have found first three and then four competing schools of thought. Our purpose is to build off Holsti and Rosenau's analyses and extend their argument. Research based on the content analysis of foreign policy and national opinion journals from 1980-1989 demonstrates that there is more diversity and complexity in the range and content of beliefs held by American leaders than Holsti and Rosenau have yet been able to capture through their ""three-"" and ""four-headed eagles."" Although the three-headed eagle serves as a useful scheme for categorizing the broad foreign policy perspectives of American leaders, it de-emphasizes important differences in beliefs and ignores at least two foreign policy orientations that exist within their general categories. This is not a mere academic exercise, for it sheds light on the level of diversity and complexity of elite beliefs, which enriches an understanding of the politics of U.S. foreign policy since Vietnam. A preliminary examination of foreign policy and national opinion journals from 1990 to 1994 indicates that American elites are changing and adapting while at the same time, they are absorbing profound global changes into their prevailing belief systems, as predicted by the political psychological literature. This suggests that the diversity and complexity present in the 80s is likely to persist and grow throughout the 90s. Our research also suggests the importance of developing alternative methods to complement reliance on survey research in order to capture more fully the diversity and complexity of the foreign policy beliefs of Americans.",University of South Carolina,['College of Charleston']

The discussion focuses on the manner in which the tensions between theoretical universalism and political critique have been ""resolved"" by theorists working in different historico-political contexts. While both these scientific and political values have been of central concern in theorizing the link between cognitive style and content, they are deeply incompatible because it is not possible to establish a fixed relationship between a personality dimension and the changing beliefs associated with different ideologies across time and place. This has prompted theorists aiming for universalistic accounts to define ideological orientation in terms of psychological processes rather than content, which, in turn, has compromised the critical potential of their theory.

Political Psychology 18, no. 3 (1997)","With the end of the Cold War, we must wonder whether there were missed opportunities to regulate the arms race and global competition, which nearly bankrupted the United States and contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. A missed opportunity for agreement is a situation where there was at least one alternative that the parties to a conflict preferred or would have preferred to nonagreement. Hard-core Realists argue that states compete for territory, arms, and influence because they have conflicting national interests. Soft-core Realists maintain that such conflicts are effects of international anarchy and uncertainty, and that states can cooperate contingent on reciprocity. I argue that states often fail to cooperate even when they have compatible preferences because policy-makers make incorrect inferences about the opponent's motives and intentions, a process that can be illuminated by social psychology. I present three alternative explanations of trust and distrust in international relations-rational choice, domestic structures, and social psychology. If policy-makers are prudent, they will assess the other's interests in observing an agreement as well as its reputation. Often, domestic political structures encourage leaders to promote distrust of an external enemy to legitimize their internal rule or foreign policy. Finally, distrust may lead policy-makers to dismiss the other side's cooperative signals or proposals. Distrust can be overcome by making a series of step-by-step agreements in which each side can test the other's good faith at limited cost, or through unilateral concessions as part of a consistent policy.","University of California, Los Angeles",[]

For instance, if asked to estimate the monetary worth of one's children, of one's loyalty to one's country, or of acts of friendship, people find the questions more than merely confusing or cognitively intractable: they find such questions themselves morally offensive. This article draws on Fiske's relational theory and Tetlock's value pluralism model: (a) to identify the conditions under which people are likely to treat trade-offs as taboo; (b) to describe how people collectively deal with trade-offs that become problematic; (c) to specify the conceptual components of moral outrage and the factors that affect the intensity of reactions to various explicit trade-offs; (d) to explore the various strategies that decision-makers-required by resource scarcity and institutional roles to confront taboo trade-offs-use to deflect the wrath of censorious observers; (e) to offer a method of dispute resolution based on pluralism.",Departments of Psychology and Anthropology,"['Bryn Mawr College', 'Department of Psychology', 'The Ohio State University']"

Using the example of ethnic conflict, I seek to bridge the two and suggest that underlying the thick description of single conflicts as the parties understand them is what an earlier generation of psychological anthropologists called ""the psychic unity of mankind,"" referring to deep structural similarities in all cultures, which make us human (Spiro, 1987). I propose that a cultural analysis of ethnic conflict can effectively build an explanation putting each conflict in a context which highlights what the parties believe is at stake; identifying both the concrete interests and threats to identity crucial to the disputants; linking interests and identities to psychocultural interpretations and the motives underlying them; and proposing that successful settlement of ethnic conflicts means that the parties themselves must actively work toward proposals which address both their competing interests and core identity needs.",Department of Political Science,['Bryn Mawr College']

The second approach is characterized by field studies and tries to assess Japanese social behavior by comparing it to that of Americans and Europeans. There is a great deal of knowledge on political behavior in Western countries which scholars in Japan often refer to in order to evaluate the significance of their survey results. But there is still limited information on the Japanese situation, and any attempt to construct a general theory in either cultural or cross-cultural political psychology will have to refer also to human attitudes in this non-Western industrial society.",Social Science Education,"['Naruto University of Education', 'Tokushima, Japan']"

As fundamentalism has become an increasingly significant political force, many different interpretations have been offered, with fundamentalism explained as both a rational reaction against modernity and as a pathological retreat from reality. We argue here that part of the scholarly failure to understand and deal with the growth of religious fundamentalism results from a failure to recognize the importance of cognitive differences in worldviews held by fundamentalists. By providing an empirical analysis of how fundamentalists see the world-what we identify as a fundamentalist perspective-we hope to supply an important missing piece in the literature on fundamentalism. To do so, we utilized a narrative and survey interview technique to contrast the worldviews of fundamentalists with those of comparable Muslims who are not fundamentalists. Our analysis suggests Islamic fundamentalism attracts because it provides a basic identity, an identity which in turn provides the foundation for daily living. The fundamentalist perspective itself is best understood through reference to a worldview which makes no distinction between public and private, in which truth is revealed by revelation, and reason is subservient to religious doctrine. Religious dictates dominate on all basic issues, and only within the confines of the fundamentalist identity are choices decided by a cost/benefit calculus.",Program in Political Psychology,"['Department of Politics and Society', 'University of California at Irvine']"

Against both of these approaches, I offer an identity-construction approach to moral motives in politics. This model focuses on the complex interweaving of self and moral motives, and in particular focuses on the concerns political activists have for what kind of person they are and what kind of life they are living. These types of concerns are both moral and self-regarding, and therefore defy the dichotomy between self- and other-regarding at the heart of both rational actor and ""dual"" motivation accounts of moral motives.",Department of Political Science,['University of Miami']

Using psychophysical magnitude measures of threat perception, these findings provide no support for the notion that threats are perceived economically. There is limited support for the theory that threat perceptions are unstable; most countries are clustered around a core of weakly hostile or friendly perceptions, which is suggestive of instability. At the same time, however, there does appear to be stability in perceptions of strong friends and enemies. The hypothesis best supported by these data is Huntington's theory that culture determines threat perceptions.

This sovereignty over the sphere of action suggests prudence as an alternative to theories of political leadership that focus too narrowly on one or another aspect of leadership, on personal characteristics or environmental constraints, for example. From Aristotle's description of prudence, it is possible to construct a framework for identifying leaders' patterns of action as prudent or imprudent. Because the framework integrates elements that existing leadership approaches separate, it can provide better explanations for success and failure. Further it holds out the hope that leaders who are conscious of personal tendencies toward error can guard against them and improve their chances for success. The usefulness of prudence as a leadership paradigm is illustrated by juxtaposing it to analyses of Jimmy Carter's presidency drawn from narrower leadership theories.",Saint Louis University,[]

Political Psychology 17, no. 2 (1996)","Research on issue voting indicates that the impact of a given attitude on the candidate appraisal process depends on its personal importance or salience (e.g., Krosnick, 1988). In the present research, we suggest that salient attitudes may be more influential because they are more cognitively accessible in memory relative to less salient attitudes. Results based on within-subject, between-issue comparisons indicate that individuals have more accessible attitudes toward issues that are highly salient to them than toward issues that are relatively less salient. Results also indicate that attitude accessibility is more closely associated with the personal importance of an issue than with the perceived national importance of an issue. Finally, in applying this accessibility analysis to the debate on the relative electoral influence of foreign versus domestic issues, we find that attitudes on the latter are more accessible and more likely to arouse self-interest. Discussion focuses on developing process models of political cognition and behavior, and on the utility of accessibility theory in providing insights into these processes.",Department of Psychology Department of Political Science,"['Northern Illinois University University of Minnesota', 'Eugene Borgida Cynthia J.

"Gross, Michael L.. ""Moral Reasoning and Ideological Affiliation: A Cross-National Study"". Political Psychology 17, no. 2 (1996)","While theories of moral development claim to be structural and bias-free, empirical data consistently report significantly lower levels of moral development among political conservatives. These findings are disturbing for two reasons: either they cast doubt on the bias-free claim of cognitive developmental theory, or they point to a fundamental moral flaw in conservative political ideology. To understand the relationship of moral development and political ideology data were collected from members of pro-life and pro-choice organizations in the United States and settlers' and peace groups in Israel (N=547). Two important changes were made in existing research designs. First, moral development and political behavior are examined in a cross-cultural context relative to ideological affiliations, i.e. actual behavior rather than subjective evaluations of political ideology. Second, a closed-end moral judgment test measuring both affective and cognitive aspects of moral development is employed. In the American sample significant cognitive differences were found between conservative and liberal subjects, the latter scoring consistently higher on all measures. These differences moderate considerably when education and income are controlled, suggesting that there is no bias in cognitive theory. This conclusion is confirmed by the Israeli sample. The Israeli subjects drew from similar socioeconomic background, and no differences in moral development were found. The Israeli groups also showed greater levels of political independence and lower levels of stereotyping than the American groups. The ramifications of these findings for political education and discourse are discussed in the conclusion of the paper.",Department of Political Science,['The University of Haifa']

We define public mood as a diffuse affective state, having distinct positive and negative components, that people experience because of their membership in a particular political community. Drawing on several different literatures, we present a typology of the etiology of public mood. Public mood has multiple origins, including chronic predisposing factors, personal and collective experiences, and discrete emotional responses to short-term events. Using a local survey, we provide a preliminary investigation of the usefulness of the typology. We then discuss some of the consequences of public mood for evaluations and judgments. We argue that public mood functions as an additional consideration in the formation of attitude responses. In our test of this idea, we find that public mood is quite influential in shaping attitudes, even when controlling for other causes.","Department of Political Science, University of Minnesota","['Department of Political Science, University of Wisconsin', 'Department of Political Science, Umed University', 'Sweden']"

Political Psychology 17, no. 1 (1996)","This analysis is based on the proposition that ""political xenophobia"" is a specific form of hostility toward foreigners that requires a chain of elements: prejudice (xenophobia) as a ""discriminatory potential,"" and a two-fold process of motivation and targeting whose elements are ideology and sense of threat (perception of negative instrumentality of foreigners). These elements together produce ""political xenophobia,"" which refers to the desire or willingness to use public policy to discriminate against foreigners. A measurement model is developed and tested using East German data from late 1990. After a measure of ""threatening"" foreigners is tested, the general model is used to examine gender differences. Results show that males showed the highest absolute levels of prejudice, rightist ideology, and sense of threat emanating from foreigners. Though all factors were less intense among females, threat played a comparatively greater (and ideology a lesser) role than among males. This suggests that it is not the absolute level of prejudice that is most critical, but the convergence of ideology and a sense of threat in the political culture that produce political xenophobia.","Department of Political Science, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee",[]

Economically and culturally marginalized groups continue to endure untold degrees of suffering. From a moral point of view, it is imperative that social scientists attend to the needs of the oppressed. This paper examines the dynamics of oppression in postindustrial and emerging states from both a psychological and political perspective. The reality of oppression may be understood from various levels of analysis, from the macrolevel of global economic and political structures, to the microlevel of internalized psychological images of inferiority. A comprehensive analysis of oppression will emerge only from an interdisciplinary approach that integrates the political with the psychological. Otherwise, efforts to reduce conditions of oppression will be inhibited by limited perspectives that neglect either the internal or external domains. We explore some of the psychological mechanisms accounting for oppression, such as learned helplessness, internalization of hegemonic self-rejecting views, and obedience to authority. Some of the political mechanisms accounting for oppression in emerging countries include the oppressive structure of international financial systems and internal colonization. We conclude by outlining the process of conscientization necessary to overcome conditions of oppression at all levels of analysis.","Department of Psychology, Wilfrid Laurier University","['Department of Political Science, Wilfrid Laurier University']"

Political Psychology 17, no. 1 (1996)","Many scholars view integratively complex reasoning as either cognitively or morally superior to integratively simple reasoning. This value judgment is, however, too simple to capture the complex, subtle, and even paradoxical linkages between integrative complexity and ""good judgment"" in historical context. Our case studies add to the growing literature on this topic by assessing the integrative and cognitive complexity of policy statements that Winston Churchill and his political adversaries made during two key foreign policy debates of the 1930s-the appeasement of Nazi Germany (where contemporary opinion overwhelmingly favors Churchill) and the granting of self-government to India (where contemporary opinion overwhelmingly favors Churchill's opponents). In both private and public, Churchill expressed less integratively complex but more cognitively complex opinions than did his opponents on both Nazi Germany and self-government for India. The results illustrate (a) impressive consistency in Churchill's integrative but not cognitive complexity in both private and public communications over time and issue domains, and (b) the dependence of normative judgments of styles of thinking on speculative counterfactual reconstructions of history and on moral-political values. We close by arguing that, although integrative complexity can be maladaptive in specific decision-making settings, it can still be highly adaptive at the meta-decision-making level where leaders ""decide how to decide.""

Knowledge of the illnesses of Cleveland, Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, and the attack on Reagan in 1981 has stimulated an inquiry into the guidelines for invocation of the 25th, the role of the vice-president and the cabinet, and the behavior of physicians and the president in concealing their health problems from the public. The health of the presidential candidates has generally attracted far less attention, even with the example of an enfeebled Franklin D. Roosevelt who died less than three months after inauguration. During the election of 1992, however, important questions of health and the public's right to know arose in the campaigns of a number of the candidates. George Bush's hyperthyroidism was well publicized, but the potential effect of the rapid destruction of his thyroid gland by radioactive iodine was not generally understood. Paul Tsongas' doctors declared him ""cancer free"" following marrow transplantation for his lymphoma, when in fact he had a recurrence that required treatment one year later. Pat Buchanan concealed his valvular heart disease from the electorate until after the last primary, even though cardiac surgery had been scheduled for valve replacement. Perot, described as a ""paranoid with delusions"" by Bush's press secretary, stonewalled when asked about his health and refused even to provide a doctor's letter to reporters. Clinton defended his ""zone of privacy"" and at first rejected interviews on the subject of his health. Later, after criticism by major newspapers, his physicians were allowed to write detailed letters and to be interviewed by the press.

The ""counting of factors"" as the dimensionality of ideology is an exercise doomed to triviality by its own basic logic. Error variables may have substantial item spans and may embody numerous higher-order factors. Additional complications arise because there is no consensus on whether to count factors whose effects bypass intervening levels, or whether directed effects between the conceptual factors alter the rules for counting. Discussions of ideology are appropriate only after one has controlled for the contribution that mundane causes make to consistencies among the attitudinal items.

In intransigent ethnic conflicts, those core dispositions which invoke security fears and deep-seated threats to identity, are used by groups and individuals to interpret the motives of opponents in ways which often prevent groups from addressing the competing substantive interests which divide them. Conflict management proposals which follow from psychocultural interpretation theory focus on either altering disputants' deep-seated mutual fears surrounding issues of identity and security in intense conflicts or in lowering their salience. To do this, parties must come to recognize the connection between past losses and present fears, and to engage in collective grieving, mourning, and reconciliation.

It examines the role of the third party and the functions of intervention in each of the workshop phases. It also shows how the larger conflict on the ground interacts with each phase and so affects the evolution of the relationship between the workshop teams and the progression of the workshop phases.

                            Decision-Making: A Sociocognitive Approach"". Political Psychology 16, no. 2 (1995)","This essay calls both for much greater attention to a relatively neglected but critical issue-area in foreign policy analysis, that of risk, and for a departure from a rational choice approach in the direction of a sociocognitive approach to risk. The sociocognitive approach to risk and risk-taking introduced here represents a substantial departure from the rational choice approach that has dominated the study of risk in foreign policy decision-making. The essay redefines and reconceptualizes the nature of risk in international politics in a manner that is in our view more consistent with actual decision-makers' behavior. Unlike the ""black boxing"" of the concept of risk that is evident in the rational choice approach to studies of risk, this study opens the ""black box"" by first disaggregating it into actual risk, perceived risk, and acceptable risk-and then by detailing the attributes of risk. This, we believe, is an essential first step toward a more realistic, accurate, and policy-relevant analysis. The approach presented here views risk as a social construct. Therefore, in explaining diversity in risk preferences, we focus on the taste for risk as a source of variety in risk preference across individuals, and on the process of problem-framing and communication. How risks are framed, especially when problems are ill-defined, becomes highly consequential for how decision-makers will understand and respond to it, and how effectively risk will be communicated both within the decision-making system as well as to outsiders.",Department of International Relations,"['The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel']"

False consciousness is defined as the holding of false beliefs that are contrary to one's social interest and which thereby contribute to the disadvantaged position of the self or the group. It is argued that considerable psychological evidence for false consciousness exists and that a thorough understanding of the phenomenon integrates several lines of research on the problem of political acquiescence. Six basic types of false consciousness are proposed: (1) Failure to perceive injustice and disadvantage, (2) Fatalism, (3) Justification of social roles, (4) False attribution of blame, (5) Identification with the oppressor, and (6) Resistance to change. Because the concept of false consciousness is likely to arouse suspicion because of its Marxian origins, several theoretical and methodological objections to the scientific study of false consciousness are raised and addressed.",Department of Psychology,"['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT 06520-8205']"
"Simon, Herbert A.. ""Rationality in Political Behavior"". Political Psychology 16, no. 1 (1995)","Public choice theory borrows the basic assumptions of neoclassical economics about the nature of human rationality and applies them to the explanation and prediction of behavior in the political domain (Downs, 1957). An attractive, and seductive, feature of the theory is a very strong rationality assumption (maximization of subjective expected utility) that appears to permit a great deal of explanation and prediction without the painful necessity of first constructing an empirically based theory of human behavior, in particular, a theory of the nature and limits of human rationality. To an important extent, deductive reasoning from the theory's basic postulates of rationality substitutes for a great deal of costly empirical inquiry. The frequent use of public choice theory today in political science calls for an examination of the assumptions of rationality that the theory employs. This paper carries out such an examination. The analysis focuses on three issues: the nature of the rationality assumption, the orthogonality of rationality and selfishness, and the possibility of altruism. Our inquiry will lead us to the conclusion that human rationality is much more complex than it is portrayed to be in neoclassical and public choice theories, and that much less can be derived by deductive means from the (amended) assumptions of rationality than has been supposed by the exponents of those theories. An important corollary to this conclusion is that a veridical theory of public choice requires a solid foundation of empirical fact about the nature of human goals and about the processes that people use in reasoning from their actions to their values.",Carnegie Mellon University,[]

Political Psychology 16, no. 1 (1995)","Claims to understanding the nature of human nature must be evaluated empirically. Specifically, understanding implies an ability to predict (although not vice versa), an ability greater than the benchmark ability based on characteristics and categorizations naively used in social prediction-such as age, gender, social and educational status, medical and legal history, and so on. Moreover, an understanding of human nature implies a predictive ability that is greater than that obtained from a consideration of single characteristics and variables additively combined. A range of results indicates that such additive, ceteris paribus, prediction is all that results from social science research-and that many of the variables used in such prediction are of the benchmark variety. Given the lack of validity of predictions based on nonlinear, hierarchical, or interactive assumptions about human nature, we can conclude that social science claims about understanding it are unwarranted. Psychologists and other social scientists can, however, use their ceteris paribus knowledge of important characteristics to influence human behavior and important social outcomes.",Carnegie Mellon University,[]

Discussion then turns to the adequacy of the political economist's understanding of the interplay between institutions and individuals as it occurs through the medium of choice. The focus here is on both the assumed effectiveness with which institutional arrangements influence individuals' choices and the assumed ease with which individuals' private wants are expressed through the choices they make. It is argued that this understanding depends on certain key psychological assumptions regarding cognition and motivation. A review of the relevant psychological research suggests that these underlying assumptions are incorrect and therefore that any analysis of politics based upon them will be inadequate. The argument concludes with a brief sketch of the kinds of concerns which should orient political analysis if it is to be consistent with the general thrust of current psychological theory and research.",Program in Political Psychology,"['School of Social Sciences', 'University of California, Irvine']"

Second, such limitations must be seen as an expression of a deeper clash of worldviews, a clash between a world defined by divine sovereignty, and a world defined by human knowledge and power.

The case is made that there is every reason to expect metaphors to play an important role in shaping a decision maker's analysis, thus influencing his/her policy choices. The role played by metaphors is, however, likely to be very different than is the case for historical analogies because of the key differences between metaphors and analogies.

The review highlights the symbolic racism construct (defined as the conjunction of traditional values and a racist negative affect toward blacks) and points to the need to investigate the relationship between the values and the affect. Research on intergroup behavior suggests that the values are likely to be fused with motives for in-group favoring but that whites' solidarity with other whites is likely more motivationally significant than their negative affect towards blacks.

Political Psychology 15, no. 3 (1994)","From its inception, modern Zionism offered a Jewish identity of strength and courage as an alternative to what was seen as weakness and helplessness. Following the Holocaust, death anxiety was deflected into aggressive energy when combating the invading Arab armies during Israel's War of Independence. The balance between aggression and fear of annihilation was severely upset by the threat of trauma repetition prior to the Six-Day War and the resulting release of strength, power, and aggression, which threw the country into a position of fear-denying omnipotence. The illusion of this grandiose position burst in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, and the Lebanon War of 1982 was, in part, a futile attempt to reinstate it. In encounters with the intifada, fear and aggression have been fused internally (as when firearms are used mistakenly out of fear) as well as vis-à-vis the enemy, while simultaneously the borders of the state of Israel are being psychologically re-established. Because of the intimate relationship between the individual and collective processes, the latter influence, and are in turn reflected in, the former. The individual thus reflects the severance of the balance between strength/aggression and fear of annihilation, which can be observed in cases where the person feels invaded by anxiety or, differently, expresses himself by power, aggression and heroism, disconnected from and denying fear.","Ra'anana, Israel",[]

Two sets of familial experiences which are associated with birth order were discussed. These were sibling relationships and parent-child relationships, each of which are experienced differently by children of different birth orders. It was suggested that both sets of experiences contribute to the first-born's heightened sensitivity to authority and power, which for males leads to an increased willingness and ability to exert political leadership in nonfamilial settings.

Analysis for pupils in their late teens indicates two different domains of values, each of which is argued to be typical of a particular type of modernization (industrial versus postindustrial).

I also identify logical and empirical strategies that investigators can use to check the influence of extraneous values. These strategies include rigorous skepticism toward counterfactuals that underlie causal claims in historical analyses, embedding of experimental manipulations in representative sample surveys to isolate determinants of public opinion, developing methods to translate case studies into standardized data languages so that we can more readily identify potential sources of bias, and continual open-mindedness to the possibility that patterns of thinking that scholarly observers laud as cognitively or morally superior in one set of political settings may look quite maladaptive or immoral in other political settings.

Political Psychology 15, no. 2 (1994)","The author presents his Political Personality Profiles and Styles typology, examining in the first section the dynamics underlying the model based upon the bipolar self ideas of psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut and the concepts of Karen Horney. The five profiles comprise the Master, Achiever, Performer, Follower and Loner political personality types. The author introduces a political styles framework which classifies presidents according to their cognitive process, managerial approach, leadership mode and public persona. The model identifies which styles-Controller, Calculator, Thespian, Vacillator and Dreamer-generally correspond to particular personality profile classifications. The second part of the study explores the genesis of George Bush's personality characteristics in his family, youth and early career, classifying Bush as an Achiever personality. The author also finds that President Bush represents the Calculator political style, with its particular strengths and weaknesses. The author then develops hypotheses about Bush's behavior from the Political Personality Profiles and Styles model and the development of Bush's personality and political style. The final section seeks to validate these hypotheses through an analysis of the president's management of the Persian Gulf war, particularly assessing how his decisions reflected positive and negative aspects of his Achiever personality and Calculator political style.",Affiliation not found,[]

Political Psychology 15, no. 2 (1994)","This paper examines the effect of racial cues on candidate perception and evaluation. In an experimental setting, we manipulated the race of a hypothetical candidate. Our causal model then examines how the candidate's race influences voters through stereotyping biases as well as the more ""affect-laden"" impact of racial prejudice. The experimental design affords many advantages over traditional survey research because we possess (1) complete control over the policy stands taken by the candidate and (2) an ability to eliminate confounds among the explanatory variables. We conclude by noting the pervasive influence of cognitive and affective expectations on black candidate perception and evaluation, and how these psychological biases might inhibit the formation of a ""non-racial, middle-of-the-road"" campaign by black candidates. Additionally, we note limitations of the experiment design and propose an agenda for future research.","Department of Social and Decision Science, Carnegie Mellon University",['ABSTRACT']

Making political points was by far the most frequent form of non-reply used by both politicians, followed by attacking the question. The 11 superordinate categories were further subdivided into 30 subordinate categories, which did show some stylistic differences between the two politicians. Whereas Margaret Thatcher inhibited awkward questions by attacking the interviewers, Neil Kinnock's style was much more defensive; he sometimes answered in the negative (stating at length the policies which the Labour Party would not follow), thereby simply inviting further questioning on the same topic, while also making himself appear evasive.","University of York, United Kingdom.",[]

A cross-cultural analysis of survey data from seven countries indicates that although yuppies tend to hold liberal social and ethical views, there is no evidence for their conservatism on economic matters, abstinence from political engagement or emphasis on lifestyle distinctiveness. Furthermore, the analysis provides no evidence that yuppies form part of a broader category of young left-wing professionals constituting the ""new class"" of the 1990s.

It finds that the careers of women politicians in Taiwan are strongly conditioned by their exposure to countersocialization, primarily in terms of their adult family environments. These findings are quite consistent with the arguments based on socialization theory that women's entrance into public life depends upon an individual psychological reorientation in which ""political women"" reject traditional cultural norms that limit them to subservient and privatized roles. Such a reorientation can be stimulated by a variety of factors to which an individual woman might be exposed-a mother's role model proving that women can have broader horizons, social and generational change legitimating more active roles, and (most importantly in our data) an adult family and spouse encouraging and supporting her ""empowerment"" in public affairs.","Auburn University National Tsing Hua University,","['Hsinchu, Taiwan', 'Department of Political Science,', 'University of Wyoming']"

Political Psychology 14, no. 2 (1993)","Participatory democrats hold that when individuals participate in democratic processes they are likely to become more tolerant of differences, more attuned to reciprocity, better able to engage in moral discourse and judgment, and more prone to examine their own preferences. These democratic dispositions in turn strengthen democratic processes. Notwithstanding the centrality of this self-transformation thesis to democratic theory, Jürgen Habermas remains the only democratic theorist to have developed an account of transformative processes. This he does by linking democratic discourse to individual development of critical capacities for political judgment, or autonomy. Habermas's account, however, requires reconstruction, since he for the most part addresses his ideas to problems other than those of democratic theory. Such a reconstruction suggests that the self-transformation thesis needs to be qualified: political contexts may elicit, rather than overcome, psychodynamic barriers to autonomy. This and related considerations suggest that democratic transformations of the self are more likely in some kinds of democratic contexts than others.","Department of Government, Georgetown University",[]

To test this expectation, regression models were constructed based on survey data collected during the 1988 New York City mayoral primary between David Dinkins and Edward Koch. Both the perception of racial outgroup threat and dissatisfaction with public resources predicted candidate support in registered Democrats. Thus, communal interests supplemented racial group power interests as motives for candidate support, despite apparent power conflict and resource competition between racial and class groups. Group power concerns appeared to reflect symbolic concerns with procedural justice rather than concern with personal or collective resource distributions. Symbolic racial politics may reflect social competition aimed at enhancing self-esteem through group identification.

Recently, however, some scholars have concluded that we must recognize that different individuals make these evaluations differently. Knight (1985) found that political sophistication affected the extent to which individuals rely on issues and ideology when evaluating presidential candidates. This paper finds that political sophistication has little systematic impact on the relative use of candidate's personal traits in evaluating the candidates. The results provide some evidence that the extent to which voters engage in rationalization involving candidate personal traits and issue positions is related to political sophistication.","Saint Mary's College, Notre Dame",[]
"Babad, Elisha, Eitan Yacobos. ""Wish and Reality in Voters' Predictions of Election Outcomes"". Political Psychology 14, no. 1 (1993)","This study investigated wishful thinking (WT) among Israeli voters in the 1988 election. The WT hypothesis predicts that preference will influence expectations of election outcomes. Two independent samples were investigated, nine weeks and two weeks prior to the election. Preferences were measured through voting intention and intensity of support for Labor or Likud block. Expectations were measured through predictions of who would form the next government and the numbers of seats projected to be won by each party. Additional variables included ""pure fantasy"" wish, interpretations of current political events, and long-range (10-year) economic and political predictions. The results showed substantial WT effects-predictions of election outcomes and interpretations of current events varied as a function of preferences. Labor voters showed less WT than Likud and right-wing supporters, and extreme left-wing supporters showed a reversed pattern, their expectations running contrary to preference. The overall electoral picture emerging from the respondents' predictions differed from public opinion polls published at the same time in the Israeli printed media. The discussion focused on the interplay between wish and reality, ""burnt fingers"" of Labor voters, and false uniqueness and dissonance reduction phenomena in the predictions of extreme left-wing supporters.","Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel",[]

Political Psychology 14, no. 1 (1993)","Citizens tend to hold positive, stereotyped conceptions of their own nations. Public perceptions of a nation's international involvements are guided by those patriotic stereotypes and serve to reify and perpetuate the stereotypes upon which they are based. The perpetuation of a positive national self-image helps to maintain political order, public acquiescence and policy support. Two experiments demonstrate cognitive effects of the stereotyped American self-image on perceptions of U.S. interventions. In the first experiment, subjects tended to recall stereotype-consistent interventions (U.S. support for democracy or opposition to communism), but not inconsistent intervention (U.S. opposition to democracy). The stereotype structured recall, creating perceptions which confirmed it. In the second experiment, subjects attributed helpful U.S. intervention to the nation's nature, while harmful intervention was more likely to be blamed on some outside force. Belief in American virtue biased interpretations of the interventions such that the United States continued to appear virtuous.","University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand",[]

This article reviews current concepts of the narcissistic personality, drawing special attention to the implications for political psychology. The decision-making of the narcissistic leader, especially crisis decision-making, is often impaired. The narcissistic leader has difficulty accepting criticism or new information, contributing to sycophantic advisory circles. Moreover, he may be overly optimistic concerning his possibility of success and underrate the adversary. The understanding of charismatic leader-follower relationships is enriched by understanding narcissistic transferences. Charismatic leaders often manifest the ""mirror-hungry"" personality, which is attractive to ""ideal-hungry"" personalities. The impact of the life cycle of the narcissistic leader is also explored, drawing especial attention to the heroic myth and frustrated dreams of glory. Malignant narcissism, as exemplified by Saddam Hussein; narcissistic rage; and the cognition and belief systems of the narcissist are also examined.",The George Washington University,[]

While adherents of these ideologies did not predominate among war opponents in the mass public, they played a central role in the organized opposition. Psychologically, it may be suggested that pacifism is often rooted in an introversion of aggressive impulses while socialists, in the American context, often use the dominant groups in American society as objects for externalizing aggressive impulses. Although the pacifist groups were larger and had a greater potential for influencing the political process, they allowed their effectiveness to be compromised by focusing on anti-Americanism instead of on support for a policy of sanctions against Iraq. The anti-American tone of many of the antiwar rallies lessened their effectiveness in mobilizing widespread antiwar sentiments which were based on more diffuse isolationist and/or humanistic sentiments.",Rutgers University,[]

Social-psychological research on the effects of schema activation (Milburn, 1987; Milburn & Fay-Dumaine, 1988) indicates that such activation may reduce individuals' cognitive complexity. To test the effect of the dramatic presentation of television news, dramatic news stories were taped and edited to remove the highly dramatic scenes. The edited and nonedited stories were then presented to subjects, and subjects' recall and cognitive complexity were measured. We found that, controlling for various background differences, exposure to the dramatic news stories significantly decreased subjects' recall of the information in the stories and reduced the complexity with which individuals thought about the events reported. The results raise important concerns about the contribution of the news to the public's information level and political sophistication.",University of Massachusetts,[]

We examine this relationship by focusing on the association between cognitive complexity-measured by structural as opposed to content-based indices-and the proportion of cooperative behavior exchanged between Israel and Egypt over the period of 1970-1978. The findings indicate that measures of Sadat's cognitive complexity consistently and significantly affected the proportion of Egyptian cooperative behavior vis-à-vis Israel in subsequent periods. Specifically, the higher the level of cognitive complexity in Sadat's verbal expression, the higher the subsequent proportion of cooperative behavior exhibited by Egypt toward Israel.

Political Psychology 13, no. 4 (1992)","Political and developmental psychologists have long disagreed about the potential for changing basic patterns of personality once they are established in childhood and adolescence. The preponderance of evidence from psychobiographies dealing with political leaders stresses the way in which their personalities and their political roles facilitate ego-defensive rather than ego-supportive modes of growth and adaptation. Humanistic psychology and much of the life-cycle, adult socialization research challenge these pessimistic conclusions, assuming that political leaders, like ordinary citizens, can and will seek to change what is dysfunctional and counterproductive in their profiles and development. John Vasconcellos, an innovative California legislator and leader in the human potential movement for more than 20 years, provides an unusual case study in leadership development because he has consciously and publicly utilized humanistic psychotherapy as a tool of personal and political growth. What have been the consequences-psychologically and politically?

Advocates of one perspective (skeptics) argue that good judgment is extremely rare. The international political scene is so unpredictable that most people are inevitably wrong most of the time. Moreover, the skeptics argue that when prognosticators are right, their ""hits"" are largely the product of either luck or prudent use of probability theory. Advocates of the second perspective (complexifiers) argue that good judgment is closely linked to the ability to transcend common cognitive biases and errors that vitiate most intuitive predictions. Prognosticators who think in self-critical and integratively complex ways are less likely to accept facile historical analogies, to jump to conclusions from fragmentary evidence, to persevere with first impressions despite contradictory evidence, and to fall prey to overconfidence and certainty-of-hindsight effects. Advocates of the third perspective (simplifiers or fundamentalists) argue that good judgment is closely linked to the ability to focus on a few basic processes (rational responses to economic, technological, and geopolitical trends) and to ignore short-term distractions. Drawing on the results of a preliminary study of experts' forecasts in three policy domains (the future of American-Soviet relations and of the Soviet Union itself, South Africa, and the Gulf crisis), I argue that each perspective has components of validity and that the research challenge is to identify the conditions under which each is most useful.","University of California, Berkeley",['University of California']

The theory is best known for its hypothesis that individuals are risk-averse with respect to gains and risk-acceptant with respect to losses and for its emphasis on the importance of the actor's framing of decisions around a reference point. I begin this essay with a brief summary of expected utility theory and of some of the apparent empirical anomalies in the theory.

An analysis of Roosevelt's decision-making behavior during the crisis shows that prospect theory does in fact explain it more satisfactorily than does the theory of rational choice. In addition, the analysis suggests that affect may sometimes play a role in causing decision frames to change and raises questions about Janis and Mann's account of the impact of stress on decision-making.",Columbia University,[]

Speeches by members of the government and opposition parties in the Canadian House of Commons from 1948 to 1988 were scored in terms of their ""integrative complexity,"" following the methods of Suedfeld and Tetlock (see Baker-Brown et al., 1986). Integratively complex communications are characterized by a recognition that more than one perspective on an issue can be valid and that the different perspectives can be integrated or related to one another in some manner. Results indicated that individuals in a policy-making role (government members) made speeches that were more complex than those made by individuals in an opposition role. However, when the governing party did not have a majority in the House of Commons, necessitating greater sharing of the policy-making role by government and opposition parties, the complexity of speeches by members of both parties tended to increase. In addition, the complexity of government and opposition rhetoric was related to how much time had passed since the last election. The complexity of government members' rhetoric increased over this period, while the complexity of the opposition's rhetoric declined.

It is suggested that society should not be treated as something merely outside the person that somehow has to be learned, nor as something genetically present in the form of a social instinct or an innate collective mentality. Rather, if human psychology is conceived as evolutionarily selected for constructing a societal world, the necessary connection between the human individual and society can be made without resorting to an outside imposition, at the same time as full recognition is given to the constitutive but largely unconscious aspects of social institutions.",Affiliation not found,[]

In the '50s peace research was closely tied to ideology in both German states. From the late '60s to the late '70s these ties loosened. In West Germany peace research flourished somewhat, but psychological peace research continued to lead a shadowy existence. In East Germany psychological phenomena in politics became of interest, but an autonomous PPR did not yet exist. In the early '80s, activities of the peace movement sparked PPR in both Germanies. Since unification, PPR in Germany has had two central objectives, namely, the psychological analysis of global crises in general, and the study of enemy images in the framework of psychological conversion research, but these foci may shift as a result of the Gulf War.",Affiliation not found,[]

That friendship is also evocative of some of the leadership qualities the two men brought to the founding era. Madison and Jefferson became friends because each needed an intellectual compatriot in the political arena to replace a lost relationship. However, their initial relationship was more a mentor-student relationship rather than an egalitarian partnership.

Decision-makers who have undergone such experiences may be inclined to challenge the status quo, in order to restore their sense of self-esteem, even when such behavior violates the precepts of rational deterrence theory. The foreign policy behavior of Nikita Khruschev and John F. Kennedy, during the Cuban missile crisis, is examined in detail to demonstrate the way in which feelings of shame and humiliation are frequently followed by narcissistic rage that expresses itself in acts of aggression in an attempt to alleviate those painful affects and increase feelings of self-worth. The evidence suggests that placing foreign policy leaders in positions of humiliation may stimulate their desire for revenge, invite retaliatory behavior, and, particularly in times of crisis, run the risk of all-out war.",McGill University,[]

The Finns and Danes are more self-reliant, less respectful and expectant of authorities than the Swedes and Norwegians.

If this proposition is accepted, or at least entertained, then four questions of special pertinence to American foreign policy are immediately relevant: What ""paradigm"" has guided American foreign-policy-makers during the 20th century? What are the likely characteristics of the new international environment which is now emerging and what factors are likely to shape it in the 21st century? How, if at all, should the American foreign policy-making paradigm be modified to deal effectively with this new environment and these factors? How might these changes be effected? This paper takes a first cut at question one. In this context, a policy-making paradigm has four major components: a ""perceptual prism,"" or belief system, based on historical and current experience; a set of goals or objectives, which can be subdivided into the categories of fundamental and instrumental; a set of rules or guidelines for operational policymaking; and a set of model problems and their solutions, which not only help in the development of present and future policy, but also in the socialization of new individuals into the paradigm. Each of these components is examined in some detail, thus setting the stage for addressing the remaining questions in subsequent research.",Boston University,[]

The results suggested that as expected there was polarization across all identities between Catholics and Protestants and further that within these two groups the rank order of the various identities also differed.

Political Psychology 12, no. 1 (1991)","The application of an action-theory model of personality (AMP) to analyses of political participation is presented theoretically as well as empirically. AMP establishes missing links between action theory (especially expectancy-value theories) and selected personality variables (self-concept of own competence, control orientations, trust, subjective knowledge, and value orientations), which have proved to be significant in the prediction of political activity. Thus, AMP integrates (a) situation- and action-specific expectancy-value (i.e., ""situational"") approaches and (b) personality (i.e., ""traitist"") approaches to political participation. With reference to person-situation interactions, it is postulated in AMP, that the predictive value of situation-specific person variables and that of more or less generalized personality variables is a function of the quality of the cognitive structuring of the action situation under question (i.e., the political life situation). With reference to data from 100 West German young adults, empirical evidence is presented for the deduced hypotheses (1) that conventional political participation is predicted best by situation- and action-specific variables and (2) that the exposed political participation of political activists can be predicted best by situation-/action-specific motivational variables and that of political non-activists can be predicted best by domain-specific personality variables.",Affiliation not found,[]
"Rasinski, Kenneth A., Roger Tourangeau. ""Psychological Aspects of Judgments about the Economy"". Political Psychology 12, no. 1 (1991)","Because of their interest to social scientists, public judgments about the economy are commonly measured in surveys. However, little is known about the effects of the measurement process on these judgments. We conducted two survey-based experiments designed to examine this issue. Based on recent theories of the psychology of the survey response, we examined whether judgments about the national economy would be influenced by survey context, especially for respondents who lacked strong political beliefs. Results from the first experiment suggested this was the case. When political moderates were induced by prior questions to think about their personal economic circumstances, they tended to personalize their judgments about the national economy. Using recent theory about the psychology of fairness, we examined whether judgments of economic fairness would be affected by survey context when the context suggested values related to fairness. Results from the second experiment suggest that this was also the case. When political liberals were induced by prior questions to think about economic inequalities in America, they tended to judge aspects of the American economic system as unfair; when they were induced to think about equal opportunity and the work ethic, their judgments of the fairness of the economic system were indistinguishable from those of other political groups. Results from both surveys indicate that social scientists should consider the survey measurement process from a psychological perspective, in terms of both cognitive processes and individual differences, when constructing surveys. In particular, items which solicit general judgments, or judgments linked to basic values, may be particularly influenced by the complicated interaction between three factors: measurement, cognition, and predispositions.",University of Chicago,[]

In this article we theorize on this phenomenon. We formulate a model to explain political apathy among lower-class people in the Netherlands during the mid-80s. We also speculate on and formulate an explanatory model on the motives of those who, during this period, were still inclined toward political behavior, notably toward radical political activities. The models are tested with data gathered in the Netherlands in 1985. The results of the analyses indicate that being a member of a deprived class increases the likelihood of being more anomic. In turn, anomie brings about political apathy. On the other hand, education decreases political apathy. The analyses further suggest that persons who give priority to so-called postmaterialistic values are more prone to radical political behavior than others. This effect appears to be stronger to the extent that they have less confidence in policies.",Affiliation not found,[]

These are interpreted and evaluated differently even when there is some agreement concerning the facts. But even the facts themselves come in for some disagreement. It seems clear that social scientists, like other human beings, have vested interests in the facts, theories, and values surrounding these concepts, which create as much controversy as they do presumably because they are laden with values.

He organized existing knowledge about societal, group and personality determinants of prejudice acquisition and persistence in a way that suggested new directions for research. Moreover, he brought the subject of ethnic stereotyping into the mainstream of behavioral science by treating this phenomenon as a special case of ordinary cognitive functioning. The cognitive approach has since become the dominant theoretical perspective in research on prejudice and discrimination. Allport was impressed by the apparent nonreversability of ethnic stereotypes; his pessimism about the prospects for immediate prejudice reduction in the United States remains a prevalent point of view among investigators. On the optimistic side, he discerned the inherent conflict in the American mind between two strongly held value frames, social stratification and social equality, as a psychological condition favoring attitude change as the status of racial minorities improved.

(2) That such cognitive factors are better predictors of intention to vote than background factors. Indeed, unlike existing U.S. evidence, low social status is not a predictor of nonvoting in this British sample. (3) That levels of political interest are based upon past educational achievement and existing beliefs about the political system.

We argue that in deciding whether to like or dislike candidates, voters emphasize both the candidates' personal qualities and the unique nature of the campaign environment. Since initial impressions of presidential candidates are formed before voters make direct comparisons for the general election, voters may compare their images of candidates with their intuitive ideas about ""human nature"" or ""most people.""

Alternatively, they might rely on an ""everyman"" standard, expecting their leaders to be as representative or typical as possible. Using data from the 1984 presidential election, we find that although the superman model fits the data better, the everyman model has some impact, particularly on feelings toward Reagan. This may explain, in part, the often-noted bias in favor of the incumbent.","Eugene Borgida,3 and Wendy Rahn4",[]

Consistent with earlier research, party elites saw themselves as ideologically similar to the candidates they preferred and dissimilar to candidates they did not prefer for the presidential nomination. However, respondents tended to assimilate the positions of candidates they liked more than they contrasted the ideological positions they disliked. Perceived electability had a strong influence on perceived ideological similarity, with similarity greatest when the preferred candidate was seen as a possible winner.

"Raven, Bertram H.. ""Political Applications of the Psychology of Interpersonal Influence and Social Power"". Political Psychology 11, no. 3 (1990)","A Power/Interaction model of interpersonal influence and social power is presented with particular attention to its applicability to the analysis of confrontation between major political figures. The analysis follows a series of steps, both from the perspective of the influencing agent and the target: First, it examines the motivations to influence and to resist influence, motivations which are often much more complex than the immediate extrinsic goals. These, in turn, determine the choices of influence strategies, the selection of the bases of power (reward, coercion, legitimate, expert, referent, or information) or more complex strategies, the manner or mode in which the power is exercised or resisted, and the stage-setting or preparatory devices to influence or resist influence. The degree and form of compliance are determined by all of these factors. Following the influence attempt, successful or unsuccessful, there is a reassessment of the interpersonal relationship by both the target and the agent, with the stage set for different strategies of influence and resistance in the next go-round. For illustration, the model is applied to the analysis of confrontations between Hitler and von Schuschnigg and between Truman and MacArthur.","University of California, Los Angeles",['University of California']

Political Psychology 11, no. 3 (1990)","The psychological literature on nuclear war is now sufficient to permit a preliminary delineation of the process of cognitive construction of reality. The growth in meaning is evident: from the preschool child's aversive associations which seem more related to frightening stimuli than anything ""nuclear,"" to the older teenager's comprehension and relatively sophisticated appreciation both of dangers and safeguards. The transformations over the years suggest that the expected progression in the construction of reality does occur. There is evidence, too, that teenagers' and adults' attitudes changed during the nuclear age in the direction of seeing no future after a nuclear war and supporting any action to maintain peace, short of jeopardizing national security. The current adult orientation is not unlike that implied by Einstein's call for ""new thinking"" and seems not to be controlled by denial or ""psychic numbing."" A widespread anti-war outlook combined with low level anti-war activity is typical political behavior rather than nuclear-related apathy. Research in this area has been subject to criticism, much of it self-criticism, and investigations have become more rigorous.

Political Psychology 11, no. 3 (1990)","Unilateral initiatives are discussed in terms of a social-psychological perspective. This perspective concentrates on interaction processes with particular attention paid to conditions for reciprocity between an initiator who manages impressions and a receiver who processes information. Historical perspectives on reciprocity have emphasized the normative aspects as expectations among group members who have positive sentiments toward one another. Implications for relations among adversaries are developed from more recent literatures on gaming, social, and cognitive psychology. These literatures contribute such ideas as initiatives-as-starting-mechanisms, the distinction between agreements and relationships, complex information-processing mechanisms (including the adjustment of expectations), and attribution biases in interpreting another nation's intentions. Further understanding of the attribution process is gained from work on expression games where other channels of strategic communication are highlighted. The article concludes with a discussion of the relevance of social-psychological processes for relations among nations and argues that the problem consists of defining linkages between micro- and macrolevel processes as reflected, for example, in recurring patterns of effects of behaviors and structures.",Affiliation not found,[]

Regardless of definitions, however, there is much evidence that, since 1914, aggressors have usually lost in terms of their own long-term self-interest. Thirty examples are examined. In 20 of them the results are interpreted as bad for the aggressors, in 5 as good, and in 5 as ambiguous. (The opposite was the case before 1914.) The direct, tangible reasons for loss usually consist of unexpected resistance by the victims, unexpected intervention by other countries on behalf of the victims, or both; and underlying both of these there is evidently a great lack of realistic empathy with either the victims or their potential allies.",Affiliation not found,[]

Three theoretical perspectives contribute to our understanding of life-course development: life cycle, socialization, and political generations. While most research of 1960s American student activists focused on left-wing activists, this study investigates the lives of both left- and right-wing political activists. Based on life-history interviews with 13 leaders of the left-wing Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and 11 leaders of the right-wing Young Americans for Freedom (YAF), three distinct stages in the life-course of these activists are examined and compared: their formative childhood and adolescent years, their 1960s activist-youth stage, and their postactivist adult lives. Results indicate that (1) there was political continuity in the life-course development of SDS and YAF leaders; (2) data support the life-cycle, socialization, and generational explanations for youth movements, and suggest further that these factors interacted at each stage in the life-course development of the former 1960s activist leaders; and (3) while similar in life-cycle and generational dynamics, SDS and YAF leaders differed most in their political socialization experiences.",Syracuse University,[]

The distinctive nature of their social and political views is attributed to a fairly unique combination of liberal political views and conservative economic attitudes. They are also thought to have little political involvement and to place a strong emphasis on individual welfare. Using Dutch social survey data, it is found that although yuppies hold more liberal political attitudes than non-yuppies, there is no evidence that they are more conservative on economic matters, less politically involved or place a stronger emphasis on individual prosperity. More restricted definitions of the term ""yuppie"" do not affect these results. Besides these analyses of single political and economic attitudes, an additional analysis was conducted to trace possible differences in attitudinal patterns between yuppies and non-yuppies. No such differences have been found, however. It is argued that, instead of yuppies being a specific social group, they are part of a much broader category of young, left-of-center professionals who, in line with ""new class"" theories, hold liberal political attitudes.",Tilburg University,[]

Four groups of factors are examined: 1. factors related to the illness itself, including whether the illness is physical or mental, and whether the disability is temporary or pre-terminal, total or partial; 2. factors related to the leader and his reaction to his illness, including the degree to which the leader denies or acknowledges the extent of his disability; 3. factors related to the nature of the political system including whether the society is open or closed, and whether there is a clearly defined succession process; and 4. factors associated with the medical care of the VIP patient, including the conflict between the health needs of the individual and the political needs of the system. In a closed society, with a partially disabled leader, the leader and his inner circle can become locked in a fatal embrace, each dependent upon the other for survival-the syndrome of the Captive King and His Captive Court.",Affiliation not found,[]
"Jentleson, Bruce W.. ""Discrepant Responses to Falling Dictators: Presidential Belief Systems and the Mediating Effects of the Senior Advisory Process"". Political Psychology 11, no. 2 (1990)","Cognitive and advisory process theories usually are cast as competing explanations of decision-making in U.S. foreign policy. They are more appropriately approached as complementary components of a single explanation, in which the independent variable of the President's belief system is mediated by the intervening variable of the senior advisory process. The extent of the mediating effect is a function of the degree and nature of senior advisor unity: weakest when there is senior advisor disunity, and strongest when there is dissenting unity. The cases of the Carter administration policy toward the Shah of Iran and the Reagan administration policy toward President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines bear out these hypotheses. In the Carter-Iran case the initial dissenting unity of Carter's top advisors caused support for the Shah to be much greater than predicted by the president's belief system propensities. The senior advisor disunity which emerged as the crisis worsened had much less of a mediating effect, and thus decisions came to more closely reflect the non-interventionist strategic view at the core of Carter's belief system. In the Reagan-Philippines case, initially the president's propensities to support Marcos were reinforced by the unanimity of his top advisors. The key decisions in 1985-86 which culminated in abandoning Marcos were the result of the transformation of the advisory process to dissenting unity and the consequent strong mediating effect. In thus demonstrating the interactive relationship between beliefs and process, these cases help establish the need for integrative theory.","University of California, Davis",['University of California']

Alexander George and Ole Holsti then isolated the cognitive aspects of the operational code construct and conceptualized them as a typology of political belief systems. Other scholars have applied this typology to explain the link between the beliefs and behavior of American foreign policymakers. The mixed results from these efforts have led to a revival of interest in the relationship between the cognitive and the characterological dimensions of operational code analysis.

Self-images include how a people sees itself, that which it most likes about itself, that about which it is most disturbed, the ways in which it may want to change, perceptions of the nation's history, conceptions of national purpose and interest, and views of the nation's power and limits. Regarding perceptions of enemies, the theory emphasizes the differences with which parties perceive the same issues, events, policies, and peoples, and suggests such gaps in perception as keys to understanding conflict behavior and interactions. A typology of conflict strategies is then elaborated, ranging from totalism to appeasement. It takes into account both manifest aims and latent attitudes. Each strategy is explicated in terms of the means emphasized, the characteristic beliefs about conflict entailed, and the self-images and perceptions of enemies which are its sources. A series of hypotheses is presented concerning the relationships between different types of self-images and perceptions of enemies, on the one hand, and various conflict strategies, on the other. The ultimate purpose is to understand what makes for constructive and destructive conflict outcomes.","University of California, Davis",['University of California']

In particular, failure to understand the decision-maker's perception of the constraints of the political context may result in labelling as error or distortion behavior which is quite reasonable when viewed from the perspective of that context. In order to remedy these deficiencies, psychological theories about decision-making processes must be combined with the insights of political scientists into the nature of the political process to develop a specifically political theory of decision-making. Such a genuinely interdisciplinary collaboration between political science and psychology could result in a theory of political decision-making which truly belongs in the realm of political cognition.",City University of New York,[]

This paper argues that such results too often reflect the limited ways in which researchers attempt to identify the structure of constrained belief. It adapts Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of cognitive moral development to explore an alternative measure of constraint in mass belief systems and shows that Melvin Kohn's questions about childrearing values yield a theoretically plausible, empirically reliable measure of developmental stages. This measure exhibits both internal and external validity and demonstrates marked stability over time. It also yields provocative empirical findings which suggest the need for an expanded notion of rational constraint. This study supports the claim that failure to identify a cognitive structure in mass belief systems owes more to limited conceptualization by researchers than to empirically identified limitations of citizens.",Colgate University,[]

A movie career which had started out auspiciously never did take off, and a marriage portrayed as idyllic ended in divorce. Drawing upon psychological adaptations that had served him since boyhood - the energetic attack on obstacles in his path and the avoidance of emotional and intellectual ambiguities - he was able to find new routes to professional and personal success. His turn to anti-communism and more gradual embrace of a conservative political philosophy facilitated his rise to the presidency of the Screen Actors Guild and provided him with new opportunities for work and influence. The targeting of the communists and the federal government in Washington as the sources of all that had gone wrong in Hollywood provided him with safe outlets for the anger he felt as a result of his blocked career and an explanation of what had happened to him. The avoidance of ambiguity kept him from any troubling doubts about either the motives of some of the leaders of the anti-communist impulse or its effects on the careers of those who resisted it. An interactionist life-history model is used in the analysis and hypotheses suggested for further research.

The time may have come to consider systematically an alternative approach to the conflict that pervades the relationship between the superpowers, an alternative without the major disadvantages of threat with its potential implications for instability, distrust, and mutual dislike. The alternative we describe involves using positive inducements to influence one another, potentially a powerful addition and eventually a powerful substitute for mutual threat. Mutual rewarding as a mode of influence can prove less dangerous and less expensive. At the same time, the use of rewards is a complex matter, often subtle, and certainly not readily accepted by everyone. Because of obstacles of various kinds, rewards are rarely used by adversaries.

This failure to take ideology seriously is no mere oversight; rather it arises from an absence of both adequate conceptualizations and adequate methods for the analysis of ideology. Such absences are particularly evident with regard to the affective component of ideologies, a component which is regarded, characteristically, as epiphenomenal. This article draws upon both social theory and psychoanalytic theory in an attempt to overcome such lacunae in the study of ideology and politics. It focuses upon Unionist ideology in Northern Ireland and attempts to establish the internal diversity of this ideology by specifying its core rules for the construction of three major ideological positions. These positions are understood as three major forms of political subjectivity. Kleinian psychoanalytic theory is drawn upon and reworked as a method for the analysis of these three positions. Having established the rules of an affect-laden ideological formation, namely, Unionism, a brief sketch of Unionist politics is offered.

This research's main contribution to political socialization studies is that it offers a means by which to analyze a socialization effect directed solely at the adolescent, to control (at least statistically) other confounding childhood influences, and to enable relating their adult political ideology to this influence. The wide age range of Israeli students (due to their 3-year army services and need to work) and the size of the control group (those who had never joined a youth movement) helped to surmount many of the difficulties that occur in longitudinal and cohort studies. As with any field study, perfect proof is not feasible. It is impossible to verify if all the socialization agents were accounted for, or whether some spurious correlations had occurred but, within the confines of this research method, the hypotheses, on the whole, were confirmed: (1) Adult political ideologies of former youth movement members corresponded to their movements' official ideologies, while ideologies of nonmembers were more erratic; (2) political involvement was higher among former youth movement members than among nonmembers.

The present study explores the relationship between ideology and integrative complexity in a very different political and cultural context: the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s. Systematic coding of politcy statements of key Soviet leaders revealed a number of effects: (a) Communist Party leaders classified as reformers (pro-Gorbachev) had more integratively complex styles of policy reasoning than traditionalists; (b) this difference was significant in both time periods examined (the last six months of Chernenko's tenure in office and the first six months of Gorbachev's) and was much more pronounced in the Gorbachev period.

The present approach suggests two modes of conflict termination: (1) conflict resolution whereby the conflict schema is unfrozen via undermining the conflict belief and (2) conflict dissolution whereby the conflict shcema becomes relatively inaccessible. The epistemic processes which characterize the two modes of conflict termination are discussed.",University of Maryland,[]
"Kosterman, Rick, Seymour Feshbach. ""Toward a Measure of Patriotic and Nationalistic Attitudes"". Political Psychology 10, no. 2 (1989)","The multidimensionality of patriotic and nationalistic attitudes and their relationship to nuclear policy opinions were investigated. One hundred and ninety-four college students, 24 high school students, and 21 building contractors were administered the 120-item Patriotism/Nationalism Questionnaire. One hundred and sixty-six of the college students were concurrently administered the 18-item Nuclear Policy Questionnaire. An iterated principal factor analysis was performed on the Patriotism/Nationalism Questionnaire and six factors were extracted for Varimax rotation. The results indicated that the factors were interpretable and distinct. Further analyses indicated the predictive validity of the subscales derived from the six factors for the Nuclear Policy Questionnaire, and exploratory analyses of variance examined the effects of selected demographic variables. The findings support the contention that patriotic/nationalistic attitudes entail multiple dimensions, and that they are differentially related to nuclear policy opinions. We conclude that researchers need to be more attentive to this multidimensionality, especially the distinction between patriotism and nationalism.","University of California, Los Angeles",['University of California']

Political Psychology 10, no. 2 (1989)","This paper represents a pilot study, investigating the first 1984 presidential debate between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale. We conducted surveys of debate watchers and nonwatchers before and after the October encounter, in order to assess the effects of the debate on voters' opinions. A content analysis was employed, allowing us to determine how well the candidates did in discussing the issues of greatest concern to our respondents. We find that Mondale's success in the debate was due largely to his skill as a debater (as opposed to his issue positions), while Reagan was able to effectively exploit the taxation and spending issues. We discuss the implications of this study for understanding the 1984 election, and suggest ways in which the future study of presidential debates might be enhanced.",Illinois State University,[]

Political Psychology 10, no. 2 (1989)","The role of women in Ireland has been a relatively traditional one due to the strong Catholic religious ethos and other factors. However, since the early 1970's Ireland has experienced a period of rapid social change resulting in a number of significant legislative and administrative reforms concerning women, as well as a marked increase in married women's labor force participation. However, this participation is still quite low by U.S. and European standards. This paper focusses on the role of attitudes in perpetuating inequality and rigid sex-role behavior. Attitudinal data from a representative nationwide sample are presented concerning the role and status of women, with particular reference to the employment status of married women. In addition to exploring the demographic determinants of these attitudes, a detailed examination is made of their relationship to other social attitudes and beliefs, of which a key element was found to be religiosity. A case is made that these constitute a belief system with many components reminiscent of the Authoritarian Personality. The implications of these attitudes for married women's future labor force participation and well-being are discussed.",University of Dublin,[]

Political Psychology 10, no. 1 (1989)","The consideration of the history of psychoanalysis in National Socialist Germany has set in motion a difficult process of remembering and working through. New facts have been made available concerning the analysts who remained in Germany and the integration of the Berlin Psychoanalytical Institute into the Nazi System. They were convinced that psychoanalysis could be practiced as a pure medical science even under National Socialism. They knew very well of the risk inherent in trying to preserve psychoanalysis in its pure form by relying only on themselves. As a result of their attempt to save their practice and institutions, the Institute and the ""science"" of psychoanalysis became a shell and a fetish for whose maintenance a high price had to be paid. The present controversy among psychoanalysts about psychoanalysis in Nazi Germany makes it clear that even psychoanalysis could be coopted in politically troubled times because the analysts had betrayed Freud's demand for a ""pure and untendentious psychoanalysis."" Even if the critical science of psychoanalysis could have functioned as a psychotherapeutic method in any form of society, the lessons of psychoanalysis under National Socialism illustrate the difficult situation as well as the opportunities available to the critical scientist in the contemporary context of the nuclear threat to mankind which emerged in the aftermath of the destruction of the Nazi system.",Affiliation not found,[]

Most conspicuous among the mechanisms employed in this resistance has been the need to project responsibility on to a new external enemy to replace the enemies of the past. Among German psychoanalysts, most of whom have grown up in the post-war period, there have been two traditions or strategies for reconciliation with the Nazi era. One group has repressed the history of this time. Indeed, until the 1960s literature which revealed the details of this history was not available in schools and universities. The other tradition, of remembering and reconstructing, has been equally ineffectual in enabling the larger society to take responsiblity for the Nazi past. Even within the psychoanalytic profession political activity which might lead to greater awareness and collective responsibility has been discouraged. Information about the German policy of annihilation toward the Soviet Union in World War II has been suppressed, facilitating the substitution of the USSR as a new enemy. The Soviet danger has been vastly exaggerated as another way of avoiding German responsibility for aggressive, ""Master Race"" political attitudes. Soviet peace initiatives, which might reduce the USSR's status as an enemy, have been avoided or distorted. Psychoanalysts can play a useful role in facilitating political awareness. They can represent to German society a standard of enlightment and of responsibility for the repressed elements of German history. A new level of political self-awareness may lead to the replacement of policies based on perpetual enmity with attitudes of mutual concern, security, and respect.",Affiliation not found,[]

Political Psychology 10, no. 1 (1989)","Severe life problems, and certain cultural characteristics that represent a predisposition for group violence, give rise to intense needs and to attempts to fulfill them in ways that lead the group to turn against a subgroup of society. As they harm others, perpetrators change: They learn by doing, and become capable of greater violence. Their progress along a continuum of destruction ends in genocide. Bystanders, the other members of society, share with perpetrators a cultural tilt (as well as difficult life conditions and resulting motivations). If they passively accept the victims' suffering, or join the system, they also change, undergo resocialization in values and beliefs. As a result of self-selection, psychoanalysts who remained in Berlin had more inclination to accept the Nazis. They accommodated with the system, began to change psychanalytic ideas to fit Nazi ideology, passively accepted the exclusion and persecution of Jewish colleagues and those resistant to Nazism. They changed progressively, some of them joining the perpetrators. Both ""internal"" and ""external"" bystanders have great potential power to influence perpetrators and the course of events. If they act in others' behalf they themselves change, progress along a continuum of benevolence, and can develop intense commitment to others' welfare.",Affiliation not found,[]

Political Psychology 10, no. 1 (1989)","The panel presentations evoked a moving, wide-ranging audience discussion and further remarks by the panelists. The issues addressed included the admission into the International Psychoanalytic Association after World War II of psychoanalysts who had collaborated with the Nazis; the fear and risks for professionals generally of speaking out against repressive or dangerous state policies; the career concerns which make scientists and academicians susceptible to political manipulation; the extent of moral responsibility of each individual; and the possible ways we can learn to resist socialization to genocide. We cannot afford to regard the Nazi phenomenon as unique to German society. What ""cultural tilts"" (Staub's phrase) of our own might contribute to a next, far more destructive, nuclear holocaust? Political activism, for example, we know, is not conducive to career advancement in the United States. The experience of the German analysts warns us of the danger of seeking to preserve the scientific status of a professional group at all costs. Drawing parallels between the Nazi holocaust and the nuclear arms race is filled with risks. Those who work with nuclear weapons, and believe in nuclear deterrence policies, are hoping to prevent war. Yet the nuclear arms race, like the Nazi holocaust, requires for its perpetuation the total collaboration of a society. From the panelists in this symposium we may learn a lot about the forms that our own resistance to knowing and acting may take. Even under National Socialism there were ways of resisting available to the German analysts which they did not follow. The symposium raised important questions for ISPP as an organization, especially concerning the proper balance between scientific detachment and political commitment.

Political Psychology 10, no. 1 (1989)","Psychological conceptualizations of authoritarianism have thus far failed to contribute significantly to an understanding of this phenomenon. It is argued that this can be attributed to the reductionistic interpretation of a concept pertinent to collective behavior as a personality trait dimension which is therefore primarily relevant to interpersonal behavior. As a result, research was effectively diverted into a fruitless search for correlations with intra- and interpersonal phenomena. This paper develops an alternative conceptualization of authoritarianism as the normatively held conception of the appropriate relationship between group and individual member, determined primarily by the intensity of group identification and consequent strain toward cohesion. By clarifying the significance of this construct for the understanding of individual and group differences in collective as opposed to interpersonal behavior, this perspective allows a resolution of the serious conceptual and empirical problems plaguing the area and suggests important new avenues for investigation.",Affiliation not found,[]

Many members of the Committee wanted Danton's head, but they tried to avoid publicity for fear of popular unrest. By contrast, Saint-Just sought to confront personally the powerful Danton in the open, thus endangering his life as well as the stability of the government. This incomprehensible behavior is discussed in light of recently published notes written by Saint-Just revealing that two wishes existed simultaneously in his soul, a wish to kill and a wish to victimize himself. Both could be fulfilled by challenging Danton in the National Convention to a verbal duel behind which lurked the guillotine. Saint-Just's confessions are analyzed to show that the killer-victim double wish is the psychological variable that best explains his political conduct.

Some suggest we are better served by following the ""employment rate"" - the number employed over the total adult population. This paper draws on the theory of human information processing to compare the effectiveness of the two views. Research has shown that we attach meaning to external data by associating them with retrieved bits of stored experience. Internal representations of unemployment would thus depend on the experience and expectations stored by the polity. Examining such expectations provides insight into the cognitions that citizen/decoders build from unemployment data. The analysis suggests that alleged flaws in the data are more appropriately attributed to the expectation that any single indicator can reflect all significant developments, and the consequent disinclination to integrate multiple indicators. The neurophysiological and experiential roots of these cognitive preferences are explored.",Affiliation not found,[]

This paper examines the popular appeal of Ronald Reagan by considering the national anxieties that he addresses. Prime among these anxieties is a feeling of helplessness: that our economy and society are out of control. More precisely, the anxiety is that, out of a combination of complacency and fear, Americans have abandoned the quest for mastery and control over their collective lives. Reagan labels our national retreat, from collective mastery over the public world into the apparent security of private life and private solutions, a return to the traditional verities. In so doing Reagan calls our retreat a victory. He thus protects our collective ego from a tremendous blow: not merely that we have lost national mastery, but that we have abandoned its pursuit for a strategy of individual survival.",University of Maryland,[]

Citizenship orientations included the perception of the citizen role as active vs passive, and as restricted to the political sphere vs as a broader commitment to one's community and society. Also included were political efficacy, support of freedom of speech, and political involvement. A path model measuring the effects of social and personal background variables and of family politicization was tested. The major findings indicate that respondents' age and socioeconomic status (SES) were related to their perception of family politicization. The older the respondents and the lower their SES the greater the tendency to report of low family politicization. Family politicization had a mixed effect upon citizenship orientations.

Research in the 1950s and 1960s failed to show the expected relationship between cognitive complexity and authoritarianism/conservatism. Cognitive complexity/rigidity was found to be highly multidimensional rather than unidimensional. Recent work in the field is reviewed with similar conclusions but two dissenting voices are noted: Rump and Sidanius. Close examination of the work by these authors does, however, show that their data provide poor support for that dissent.

The findings confirmed earlier work with Soviet and American adolescents in that exposure to Soviet culture was associated with increased concern over nuclear war and increased pessimism about its survivability, while exposure to American culture was associated with increased belief in the war's inevitability. Although overall the youngsters think of nuclear was as not survivable, increased belief in survivability is associated with older age, and, paradoxically, older age is also associated with increased pessimism about prevention, and with decreased concern about nuclear war. Sex differences were found in some attitudes, and findings about youngsters' belief in the relative power of the Soviet and American peoples and governments are also discussed.",York University,"['New York University', 'York University']"

Prior to that, Coolidge was a hardworking and moderately progressive political figure. As Governor of Massachusetts, he proposed legislation in a wide variety of areas and established a record of accomplishment that compared favorably with that of many other Governors of the time. His first year as president saw a politically astute Chief Executive who was actively involved in the work of his Administration and a Chief Legislator who made specific and detailed legislative requests. Following his son's death, however, Coolidge suffered a major depression and lost interest in the presidency. His workday shrank in duration, his proclivity for sleep expanded; he disassociated himself from his Administration, deferred to Congress, and declined to provide leadership even to his own Cabinet. As an explanation for Coolidge's behavior change, his childhood is explored and the midlife crisis precipitated by his son's death is examined.",Northeastern University,['Northeastern University']

The results showed that people were significantly more confident of their candidates' chances after voting than before, even controlling for any generalized optimism (p < .02).

This study applies nonimmediacy scoring (Wiener and Mehrabian, 1968), designed to measure psychological distance and positive or negative affect from nonobvious aspects of verbal discourse, to references made by Castro concerning Guevara before and after the latter's departure. The scores indicate a significant increase in Castro's negativity and distance toward Guevara across the two time periods.

Political Psychology 9, no. 1 (1988)","The antagonism between the two major nuclear powers is a continuing cause of concern. This is especially so since possession of the bomb no longer serves as a deterrent to one's antagonist. Now there is fear of the ""first strike"" and the pressure to forestall it by possessing the power to strike before the enemy can. The United States stresses the need to develop a defensive screen behind which the U.S.S.R. can only surmise that it could be attacked with impunity. It then sees no alternative but to escalate its weaponry to overcome any such advantage. The obvious end result is a further destabilized world which is brought closer to nuclear annihilation. It is incorrect now to speak of a nuclear exchange as ""a war."" The destruction would be so complete that there could be no victor and no opportunity for recovery in any foreseeable time period. In fact, an exchange of but 6,000 nuclear bombs could all but destroy the universe. The destruction of life would be so through that only the term ""nuclear ominicide"" would be applicable. The fact that no amount of effort seems to deflect the major powers from their course is patently unrealistic. In both countries, but mainly in the United States, there are those in places of influence who intentionally generate distrust among the public by various techniques. It is this distrust which permitted ""deterrence"" to seem to make sense, which has forestalled a more realistic approach and which has made omnicide an acceptable risk. This paper stresses most particularly that trust is the key to a solution of our dilemma. Without trust we are bound to stumble on without success. We must find techniques and means of generating trust among the mass of people to counteract the constant encouragement of distrust and to expose the methods by which distrust is promoted.",Affiliation not found,[]

In the author's view, secondary features can be derived from basic perceptions and attitudes which present a person's view of the world and are very stable. In order to separate the basic perceptions from the secondary features the author analyses the process of socialization in two cultures - the Soviet and the American. He identifies main channels of influence in both cultures through which society integrates a new member and three codes of conduct - based on religious ethics, law, and unwritten rules that regulate behavior in a society. They turn out to be very different in the two countries, explaining the dramatic difference in all basic perceptions of Americans and Soviets.",Affiliation not found,[]

Political Psychology 8, no. 4 (1987)","A major generalization of studies on personality and political behavior has been that personality traits of political leaders are invariant over political circumstances. This generalization is questioned on the grounds that most indirect measures of personality traits were heavily based on the content of verbal or written expressions. We hypothesize that cognitive complexity - defined in terms of the structural organization of, and interdependence among, expressed beliefs - varies significantly over political circumstances. Specifically, political leaders will exhibit higher levels of cognitive complexity in persuasion tasks that are perceived more difficult and demanding, such as peace-advocacy, than in tasks that call for straightforward argumentation and emotional participation of constituencies, such as war-advocacy. Four structural measures of cognitive complexity are derived from the cognitive mapping approach. We test this hypothesis using 21 speeches made by four Israeli Premiers over a period of 16 years. The findings indicate that these measures constitute valid indicators of cognitive complexity as a personality trait, and support the main hypothesis. This suggests that generalizations concerning invariance of personality traits over circumstances should be viewed with some skepticism. The implications of our findings are briefly discussed.",University of Haifa,[]

The revision involves a reinterpretation of their data and a relocation of the new results within the context of research hypotheses from previous studies of cognitive complexity. The general argument to justify these revisions proceeds along two lines of inquiry: (1) a critical examination of the decisions by Maoz and Shayer to aggregate their cases and locate their investigation outside the context of recent studies of cognitive complexity; (2) a projection of the consequences of disaggregating their cases and subsuming the results under the research tradition represented by Tetlock (1985).

It then becomes relevant to question how one's own, or another, society, which is analyzed, view both the analysis and the right to make it. After asking who one wishes to address with what aim in mind, the political scientist then will be concerned with whether a society is open or closed, and to what degree.

The last of these assumptions-that neither party will enter negotiations that leave its right to national existence in doubt-is linked to the psychological core of the conflict: its perception by the parties as a zero-sum conflict around national identity and existence. This view has led to a mutual denial of each other's identity and right to exist and systematic efforts to delegitimize the other. Such efforts have undermined the steps toward negotiation that leaders on both sides have in fact taken because each defines the negotiating framework in ways that are profoundly threatening to the other. Negotiations are possible only in a framework of mutual recognition, which makes it clear that recognition of the other's rights represents assertion, rather than abandonment, of one's own rights. Such negotiations can be facilitated through a prenegotiation process conducive to differentiation of the enemy image, including a breakdown of the monolithic view of the enemy camp, a distinction between the enemy's ideological dreams and operational programs, and a differentiation between negative and positive components of the other's ideology and symbols of legitimacy.",Harvard University,[]

Israel's borders before 1967 are described as constricted and rigid, whereas following the Six Day War the border situation became more complex. The new border was expanded, but rigid, while the old border remained constricted but became excessively permeable (initially from the inside out, then from the outside in). Due to the close proximity between the individual and the social processes in Israel these border changes are assumed to carry psychological implications, for the individual as well as collectively. Specifically, external reality may threaten to invade the self. This may, alternatively, be defended against by reliance on aggression and externalization.

Political Psychology 8, no. 2 (1987)","Since the birth of the Jewish state in 1948, hundreds of commentaries on media coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict have been driven by a desire to demonstrate unfair media bias-either against Israel or against the Arab states. This paper presents a brief overview of these articles; it differs from prior literature reviews inasmuch as it focuses upon the charges of partisan critics. The paper's goals are (1) to review, categorize, and evaluate these accusations, (2) to distinguish between the normative, conceptual, and empirical issues involved in judgments of media bias, and (3) to suggest an overall vantage point from which we may most usefully view the debate over media unfairness with regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Among other things, the paper argues that: 1. The media ought not rely upon ""evenhandedness,"" ""balanced content,"" or ""middle-of-the-road politics"" as guidelines for coverage of the conflict. 2. ""Scientific,"" content analytic studies of media bias have obscured the centrality of values and political orientations in judgments of unfair coverage. 3. While the media do have an obligation to adhere to certain journalistic norms and standards, it is difficult-if not impossible-to invoke these norms without making normative and conceptual judgments. 4. Structural constraints predispose the mass media toward certain types of coverage. Sometimes, limitations in media capabilities produce coverage favorable to Israel and sometimes they produce coverage favorable to the Arabs. 5. Judgments of media bias rest upon three social psychological processes: a general, cognitive confirmatory bias in judging evidence, a tendency for deeply involved partisans to have a wide latitude of rejection, and a tendency for partisans to perceive (and misperceive) media stimuli in accordance with their overall views. 6.

The technique used was to determine the extent to which emotional arousal, prompted by depictions of atrocities, translated into empathy for victims and support for remedial political action. The results demonstrate that almost all American and Australian students clearly recognize certain governmental actions as human rights violations, and most of them accept the validity of government intervention on behalf of human rights. The study also shows that most respondents expressed willingness to make personal sacrifices in defense of other people's rights.",Affiliation not found,[]

Political Psychology 8, no. 1 (1987)","This article examines the impact that publication of the Report of the State Commission of Inquiry on the massacres at Sabra and Shatila had on the beliefs of people holding conflicting political views. Differences among individuals regarding evaluation of responsibility falling on Israeli leaders for the massacres, before and after the findings were published, were found to be related to dogmatism as measured by the D Scale. While political beliefs and commitments were the most important factors shaping the views of individuals about the massacres, dogmatism proved to be of significant importance in the determination of the level and direction of attitude change generated by the availability of new authoritative information.",Affiliation not found,[]

The two groups matched on variables known to be correlated with dogmatism (sex, age, religious observance, level of education). The findings were that although dogmatism (Rokeach's D scale) was related to authoritarian attitudes (anti-Arab rights, pro-censorship of media, pro-severe punishment of criminals), it was not related to radical activity. The latter was related only to those attitudes that are part of Gush Emunim's fundamentalist interpretation of religious-Zionistic ideology.

In the 1930s, psychologists, sociologists, and educators were active in the field of propaganda analysis. At the present time, much propaganda research is being done but because it is dispersed among many disciplines it lacks a basic body of literature, a shared set of techniques, rules for evaluating its quality, and a channel of communication between scholars doing such research. After using examples from American print journalism to describe the range of means by which propaganda may be spread, this article discusses the considerations that would be relevant in reformulating a science of propaganda as a subdiscipline of political psychology.",Affiliation not found,[]

The presented model is composed of two main types of relations: the relations of sex, referring to sexuality, reproduction and consumption; and the relations of work, regarding aspects of women's experiences in the labor market. Additionally, several arenas of involvement are included in the study. As a first test of the model the life situations of two groups of women, totally opposite to each other with regard to participatory behavior, are compared. The results of this test indicate that the model is highly relevant. The multivariate analyses display women's age-specific arena preferences. Both generational and life-cycle perspectives are used in the interpretations of these results. With regard to the question of class, we find women's own occupational status to be a necessary indicator in behavioral studies.",University of Minnesota,[]

These include those directed at deep causes (the U.S.-Soviet relationship), intermediate causes (imperfect rationality of decision-makers) and, briefly, precipitating causes (effects of stress). In each case, little or no influence on the nuclear policy-making process can be discerned; U.S. foreign policy-makers charged with managing the risk of nuclear war operate virtually independently of psychology. In order to bring nuclear policy-making and psychological insights together, a phenomenological approach to nuclear crisis management is described, the central task of which is a systematic description of the evolution during crises of beliefs held by decision-makers about risk of nuclear war.","Dear Professor Freud,","['every conflict...

These differences are not always reflected by conventional measures of liberalism-conservatism; a more promising approach is by Tomkins' Polarity Scale that measures left/right affinities in a number of ideological domains. This paper reviews Polarity Theory and the findings from studies employing the Polarity Scale (such as differences in emotional lability; differences in predominant affective response, positive or negative; possible differences in ""blaming the victim""). The findings are sparse because of the limited use of the Polarity Scale. To supplement these findings, a survey of the psychological literature on behavioral differences was made, with special attention to ""anomalous"" differences between liberals and conservatives (i.e., differences that seem inexplicable on the basis of ideological content alone). These anomalies both support and contradict Tomkins' theory, but it is clear that the conceptual structure provided by Polarity Theory is of great value in organizing the findings in this area.","University of Maine, Orono",['University of Maine']

Overt and covert organizational roles are shown to reflect individual psychological adaptations to and defenses against the anxieties of organizational and interpersonal uncertainties. The psychoanalytic orientation is proposed as advantageous for analyzing the dynamics of role performance in bureaucratic organizations under stressful conditions. These conditions may result from typical bureaucratic events such as administrative cutbacks and transitions in administrative leadership. A case example of a transition in administrative leadership illustrates defensive tendencies and role performances among key staff members. A table shows a variety of defensive actions in hierarchical positions. And, finally, we construct a psychodynamic model of psychological defensiveness and role formation.",University of Missouri,[]

"Wolfsfeld, Gadi. ""Evaluational Origins of Political Action: The Case of Israel"". Political Psychology 7, no. 4 (1986)","This study presents a tentative model for explaining political action, and tests it using data from a representative sample of the Israeli population. Previous studies in the field have made progress in this area by showing that citizens make reasoned choices about the type of political participation they elect. The model presented here attempts to improve upon this area of work in a number of ways. First, it tries to deal with the effects of both political resources and skills as well as evaluational influences within one model. Second, it is designed to specify those particular attitudes and norms which are related to the choice of different modes of political action. Finally, it is tested using reports of actual behavior, rather than behavioral intention. The model makes a distinction between those variables which are more related to the potential for action, and those that affect the type of action the individual chooses. While social background and psychological involvement in politics help determine if one will participate, it is one's attitudes and norms toward the different modes of behavior that determine how one will act. In this initial model a distinction is made between mobilization attitudes and norms and institutional attitudes and norms. By making such a distinction, the model helps show how individuals decide to either do nothing, participate in only one type of action or use both. Four ideal types are presented to reflect such choices and are labeled as Inactives, Conformists, Dissidents, and Pragmatists. The model is tested through a survey using questions designed to represent differences in both political resources and skills and attitudes and norms toward institutional and mobilized action. In general, the data do support the model and show that a specification of attitudes and norms does lead to a better understanding about the ways in which people choose to participate in politics. The analyses also illustrate what the two forms of action do and do not have in common. While the three active types all tend to come from better social backgrounds and to be more psychologically involved in politics, they differ with regard to their beliefs about the effectiveness, worth, and appropriateness of the different forms of political behavior.",Affiliation not found,[]

"Ross, Marc Howard. ""A Cross-Cultural Theory of Political Conflict and Violence"". Political Psychology 7, no. 3 (1986)","It is difficult to conceive of a human community where there is no conflict among the members or between persons in the community and outsiders. At the same time, the degree to which conflict is overt varies widely. This paper examines structural and psychocultural hypotheses to account for this variation, and then tests them using multiple regression with data from a worldwide sample of 90 preindustrial societies typically studied by anthropologists. While the statistical results provide some support for both explanations for internal and external conflict, more interestingly, the two are integrated to form a general theory of conflict behavior. Our argument is that pyschocultural dispositions determine a society's overall conflict level, while its structural features shape whether the targets of aggression lie within the same society, in other societies, or both. The common psychocultural roots of both internal and external conflict are harsh socialization patterns, low warmth and affection directed at children, and high protest masculinity. The structural roots of internal and external conflict differ. Internal violence is associated with weak cross-cutting ties, strong localized male groups (in uncentralized societies), and polygyny; while external conflict and warfare are found in societies which are high on socioeconomic complexity, where polygyny is absent, and in uncentralized societies with martial endogamy and weak cross-cutting ties.

Doing so reveals a great deal of behavior that contradicts the bulk of the psychological theory in this area. Far from paying little attention to prior probabilities, decision-makers often rely on them. Part of the reason for this is that these prior probabilities can be quite readily transformed into causal arguments. Although the distinction between priors and information about the instance at hand is clearly in laboratory settings, this is not true for foreign policy judgments. But once the necessary transformations have been made, the results indicate that the theory-driven nature of perception leads to a major role for priors.",Columbia University,[]

In the first and second sections we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the process of making Turning-Point Decisions (TPDs) with special emphasis on decisions leading to normalization of relations between enemies. Using this framework the normalization process is explained as follows: Decisions on cooperation with the enemy, reached after harrowing conflict, cause cognitive dissonance to the actors supporting these decisions. Resulting dissonance will be resolved by a change of attitude toward the enemy, bringing it into line with the decision supported by them. The last section presents the main findings of the application of this framework to a specific case: three TPDs taken by Israel with regard to West Germany between 1950 and 1965. The findings support the main hypothesis of this paper: the harsher the predecisional conflict and the stronger the postdecisional dissonance, the greater the consequent change in attitude toward the enemy.",Affiliation not found,[]

Rational actor theories provide the missing element: an account of motivation. However, either the predictions of most of these theories contradict empirical observation, or the theories become apolitical. A rational actor theory is sketched that overcomes these limitations. This theory recasts the participation problem by adding ""leaders"" and ""groups"" to the more common voters and candidates. Those voters who identify with others can receive sufficient incentives from leaders to participate, despite the low probability of their single actions having a political effect. The leaders, however, provide these incentives because of political policy calculations. Consideration of those incentives which are grounded in group norms leads to proposal of a view of rationality in which individuals may try to minimize the ""distance"" between themselves and others, instead of only, as in the more usual view, maximizing egoistic possession of ""goods.""

If unemployed for a very short time they explained their own unemployment in terms of the failure of the system to provide jobs and the unemployment of others in terms of personal inadequacies.

"Wilkins, Lee. ""Leadership as Political Mentorship: The Example of Wayne Morse"". Political Psychology 7, no. 1 (1986)","James McGregor Burns' theoretical work on leadership focuses on three types, the most potent of which is transformational leadership. Such leadership, Burns says, elevates both leader and followers. However, because of the scope of Burns' work, he spends little time focusing on the psychological processes which allow transforming leadership to affect historic change. One method which the transforming leader may use is that of political mentorship. Political mentorship differs from traditional mentorship in that it is accomplished without the close personal contact that accompanies more traditional mentorship. However, political mentorship accomplishes the same goal: it allows the follower to move from political adolescence to political adulthood. Political adulthood is defined not as a function of age but rather achievement of political maturity-that is the individual strength to resist societal coercion on issues involving a universal moral-ethical principle. Wayne Morse, former Oregon Senator, served as a mentor to the Vietnam peace movement in several crucial ways. First, Morse acted as an ""establishment authority figure"" who believed in the goals of the movement strongly enough to hammer at them in speeches on the Senate floor and on many college campuses. Second, Morse opposed the war on universal-ethical grounds; he insisted the war was unconstitutional and that the conflict itself was a national civil war in which the United States had no right to interfere. Third, Morse insisted that individual Americans take responsibility for the continued prosecution of the war. Such an insistence forced many to begin to develop the moral and ethical depth characteristic of the political adult. Morse's actions constituted the sort of behavior expected from a traditional mentor. He became a political mentor. Therefore, transforming leadership should be viewed as leadership which allows followers to develop political maturity. In this sense, such leadership does not transform followers, it allows them to call upon what is best in each individual and to exercise those abilities through specific political actions.",Affiliation not found,[]

Political Psychology 7, no. 1 (1986)","This article introduces the theory and approach of structural anthropology and applies it to a problem in American political science. Through this approach, the ""bipartisan foreign policy hypothesis"" and the ""two presidencies hypothesis"" are reformulated and reconsidered. Until now participants in the debate over each have only rarely built on, or even cited, the other's research. An additional problem is that the widespread conventional wisdom in support of the two hypotheses is inconsistent with systematic scholarly analyses. This paper demonstrates that the two hypotheses are drawn from the same underlying structure. Each hypothesis and the theoretical model it implies is conceptually and empirically extended to take into account the differences between congressional leaders and members. Then, historical examples and statistical analyses of House roll call data are used to demonstrate that the hypotheses, while sometimes supported for the congressional members, are far more applicable to leadership decision making. Conclusions suggest that conventional wisdom be revised to take these differences into account.",York University,"['New York University', 'York University']"

"Carpini, Michael X. Delli. ""Work and Politics: A Decomposition of the Concept of Work and an Investigation of Its Impact on Political Attitudes and Actions"". Political Psychology 7, no. 1 (1986)","The relationship between work and politics has been studied both theoretically and empirically. As the method of analysis becomes more rigorous and generalizable, however, the treatment of the concept of work becomes more simplistic and peripheral. Case studies have helped to alleviate this problem, but have certain limitations of their own. Using data from a national sample of the United States (the 1978 General Social Survey), the concept of work is decomposed into eight more specific elements and the interrelationships among them and political attitudes, opinions, and behaviors are tested. Work is found to have a complex impact on political orientations that is only partially captured by its usual operationalization-occupational title. A relatively constant overall effect of work on different forms of political involvement also masks a changing pattern of impact among the more specific elements of the work experience.",Affiliation not found,[]
"Klugman, Jeffry. ""Hawks and Doves"". Political Psychology 6, no. 4 (1985)","The conflicting strategic assumptions of hawks and doves, and the different worldviews they exemplify, prevent mutual understanding and preclude effective negotiations between the two camps. Contrasting nuclear strategies rest on different assumptions about the possibility of limited nuclear wars, and these assumptions as well as domestic ideologies stem from the hawks' focus on boundaries and differences, and the doves' focus on connections and similarities. These cognitive differences are both effect and cause of the hawks' concerns about aggression and dominance, and the doves' concerns about death and nurturance. The lack of balance in each side's concerns derives from the lack of a healthy synthesis resolving the tension between differentiation and fusion. Only by mourning both death and aggression and by accepting both separation and connection can we find the emotional basis for a new nuclear strategy.",Yale University,[]
"Friedland, Nehemia, Ariel Merari. ""The Psychological Impact of Terrorism: A Double-Edged Sword"". Political Psychology 6, no. 4 (1985)","Political terrorism is a sophisticated form of psychological warfare which aims to accomplish political ends by bearing on individuals' emotions and attitudes. This article presents the results of a public opinion survey, conducted on an Israeli national sample, which was designed to evaluate the psychological impacts of terroristic activity and the basic assumptions that guide it. The results indicate that terrorism is highly effective in inducing fear and worry, even when the actual damage it causes is moderate. However, terrorism appears to have failed to produce the attitudinal change desired by its perpetrators, the high levels of fear notwithstanding. On the contrary, terrorism caused a hardening of attitudes, strong opposition to any form of political reconciliation with terrorists, and widespread support for extreme counterterrorist measures. Terrorism, in other words, proved to be counterproductive. These results provided a basis for an extensive analysis of the conditions that turn terrorism into a potentially effective tool of political influence, and those in which it is likely to fail.",Tel Aviv University,[]
"Falk, Avner. ""Aspects of Political Psychobiography"". Political Psychology 6, no. 4 (1985)","There are two fascinating sets of questions involved in the writing of political biography and psychobiography: (1) What is the nature of such biography, its source materials, methods, aims, functions, uses and misuses; and (2) what are the emotional forces, conscious and unconscious, which propel people to become political biographers and to pursue their biographical labors with great zeal and perseverance? In this paper I shall attempt to answer these questions by reviewing the literature on literary biography, psychobiography, and, finally, political biography and political psychobiography. From the literature, several themes seem to emerge which provide clues to the answers. The main theme of this paper is that the writing of a political biography is the writer's way of telling a very important story about his own life. The political psychobiographer may be more aware of his motivations in writing his biography, but there are still many pitfalls along the way.",Affiliation not found,[]

This paper reports two studies-one on sex differences in sociopolitical beliefs, and the second on national differences. The first study showed numerous differences, with females being, overall, less conservative than males except on issues relating to religion and punishment. The second study showed that matched groups of South African and British school children (aged 17 years) held widely different sociopolitical beliefs on a number of issues, the former being predictably more conservative than the latter.

Political Psychology 6, no. 4 (1985)","The study investigated the relationship between several dimensions of sociopolitical ideology (i.e., general conservatism, racism, political-economic conservatism, religion, sexual repression, and authoritarian aggression) and certain forms of cognitive functioning (e.g., cognitive complexity and cognitive flexibility) within a political domain. The data were examined with respect to three competing theories concerning the nature of the ideology-cognitive functioning interface: (a) authoritarian personality theory, (b) the extremism theory, and (c) context theory. The subjects consisted of 195 Swedish high school students from five different high schools in greater Stockholm. The results showed no index convergence for the concepts of cognitive complexity and cognitive flexibility although general construct validity was found for the cognitive assessments instruments used. The results also revealed that four dimensions of sociopolitical ideology (general conservatism, racism, sexual repression, and authoritarian aggression) showed weak but statistically reliable relationships to cognitive flexibility and cognitive complexity from one cognitive assessment instrument. The nature of the results gave strong support to authoritarian personality theory and partial support to context theory. No support could be found for the extremism theory.",University of Texas,[]
"Diamond, Michael A.. ""The Social Character of Bureaucracy: Anxiety and Ritualistic Defense"". Political Psychology 6, no. 4 (1985)","In the analysis of the social character of bureaucracy, one must examine the psychodynamics of obsessional neurosis in the individual and ritualistic practices in the bureaucracy. Much of organization theory either implicitly or explicitly characterizes bureaucratic activity as ritualistic. Such behavior results from obsessional thinking and compulsive action in the individual aimed at defending the self from anxiety over losing control. Ritualistic individual behavior serves to contain anxiety stemming from the uncanny experience of momentary loss in self/object boundaries and identity. This may occur in the organizational recruit at the moment of entry into the bureaucracy where one acts to deny reality by ""undoing"" the self-alienation that has occurred (signal anxiety) and ""isolating"" its affects (Freud, 1959a). Managing self/object boundaries and controlling ambivalent feelings emerges as primary motivating actions in the newcomer. Consequently, the new organizational member finds his defensive and regressive actions consistent with ritualistic tendencies and bureaucratic practices. The psychoanalysis of ritualistic behavior elucidates the human construction of and adherence to a bureaucratic form of organization as the outcome of the obsessional neurotic's actions in securing himself against anxiety about losing control over the impulses of the id.",University of Missouri,[]
"Baum, Howell S.. ""Predicaments of Bureaucratic Subordinacy: Dramatic Escape and Compensation"". Political Psychology 6, no. 4 (1985)","Bureaucracy presents workers with predicaments which frustrate efforts to act competently. Simultaneous ambiguity in responsibility and authority both defeats interests in recognition and creates risks of being scapegoated for problems. At the same time, the structure of bureaucratic authority engenders shame anxiety which discourages assertion and further hinders effective work. Workers defend themselves against this anxiety by producing dramas which offer escape and compensation. These dramas may be daydreams, plans for the future, or actual plays performed alongside formal organizational activities. This paper examines two workers' dramas. The dramas offer security, with the result that the workers regard them as more ""real"" than other activities and withdraw from their formal assignments.",The play's the thing,"[""Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king."", 'William Shakespeare, Hamlet', ""We're all in this alone."", 'Lily Tomlin', 'destiny than the one he forges for himself on this earth.', 'Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness', 'Luigi Pirandello, Autobiographical Sketch in Le Lettere (Rome)']"

The major argument holds that if people are to manage a complex environment they are compelled to organize and simplify that environment psychologically. Understanding these cognitive processes makes it possible to gain insights into patterns of decision making and adaptation to political change. The first part of the paper develops a framework depicting the political world view that results from the need to organize and simplify the environment. Based upon findings in psychological and political research, it is argued that several patterns of behavior should result from particular elements of the political world view. The second part of the paper uses United States negotiations with Mexico regarding the importation of natural gas to the United States as a case study to demonstrate the utility of the framework.",Affiliation not found,[]

My thesis is that Maoism has attempted to induce adherence to a set of values that govern activities underlying political behavior. I examine both the frequency of appearance of certain items and the tendency of various ideas to be associated together in commentary and conclude that not only has the logical structure of Mao's thought affected the manner in which the leadership has perceived the proper conduct of these activities but also that various ""weights"" have been given to various themes at different times. This reflects the shifting priorities of the elite. Moreover, these varying emphases reflect an assumption on the part of the leadership of the malleability of the human mind, as well as considerable faith in the power of propaganda as a tool for reinforcing desirable perceptions.",Moorhead State University,[]

A questionnaire including both knowledge and attitude items was administered to students at a small liberal arts college in North Carolina: (1) after they had been shown ""Protection in a Nuclear Age,"" a movie produced and distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); (2) after they had been shown ""The Last Epidemic"" a movie produced by Physicians for Social Responsibility; (3) after they had read The Fate of the Earth, a book written by Jonathan Schell; or (4) with no prior stimulus material. Results indicated that those who saw ""The Last Epidemic"" or read The Fate of the Earth were more informed than the control group, but those who saw ""Protection in a Nuclear Age"" were not. In addition, those who saw ""Protection in a Nuclear Age"" were more optimistic than the control group about the likelihood of surviving a nuclear war, those who saw ""The Last Epidemic"" or read The Fate of the Earth saw greater dangers in the power and effects of nuclear weapons.

"Scott, J. P.. ""Application of Biological Concepts and Techniques to Human Political Problems: An Introduction"". Political Psychology 5, no. 4 (1984)","In this series of four short papers, the authors examine two major propositions concerning the relationship between biological science ad political science. The first is that since biologists have a well-established set of techniques for studying the function of living systems, these should be applicable to the study of human political organizations as special forms of living systems. The second is that the concepts developed from the study of living systems should also be applicable to political systems. In this introductory paper, I first list some of the basic concepts and techniques developed by the biological sciences, indicate how these might be used to further our knowledge of political science, and finally conclude that the most important basic concept common to both sciences is that of power. In the second paper, Banks describes how power is expressed in a flock of hens, leading to the concept of social dominance. He concludes that this phenomenon, closely related to the human phenomenon of social status, is strongly affected by individual variation, another biological concept that must be taken into account in explaining human behavior. Vessey describes the same phenomenon in the more complexly organized societies of rhesus monkeys. Physical size and fighting ability appear to be less important determinants of rank among males than are seniority and the status of the mothers, but rank does seem to be correlated with reproductive success. Whether or not the same phenomena exist in human societies, the results emphasize the complexity of dominance relationships. In the last paper, Freedman uses another biological concept, that of the reproduction of social groups by fissioning. He suggests that, just as with social dominance, division is strongly affected by biological relationship systems. In so doing, he brings in a major biological concept, that of evolution, suggesting that antagonistic group fissioning may be one of the factors contributing to the remarkably fast pace of past human evolution.",Tufts University,[]
